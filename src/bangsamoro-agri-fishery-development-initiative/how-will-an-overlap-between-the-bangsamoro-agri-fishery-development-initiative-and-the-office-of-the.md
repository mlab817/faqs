### Bangsamoro Agri-fishery Development Initiative

## How will an overlap between the Bangsamoro Agri-Fishery Development Initiative and the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process (OPAPP) Livelihood Investment Support Program be avoided?


 - The Livelihood Investment Support Program for Normalization specifically tackles Decommissioned Combatants and their communities, while the Bangsamoro Agri-Development initiative aims to provide support for the agri-fishery industry in the area that is outside of the sphere of influence of MILF Camps.
