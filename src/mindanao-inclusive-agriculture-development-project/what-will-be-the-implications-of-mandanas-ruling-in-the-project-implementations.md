## What will be the implications of Mandanas ruling in the project implementations?


 - The DA will secure an IMA (Implementation Management Agreement) similar to letter of commitment or MOA with the LGU to indicate the responsibilities of the parties involved. 
 - Meanwhile the counterpart of the LGU is 10% for the Component 2, but once the Mandanas Ruling is implemented the LGU share will be increased to 13%.
