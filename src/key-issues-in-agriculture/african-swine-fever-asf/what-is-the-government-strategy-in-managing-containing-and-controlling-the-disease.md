# What is the government strategy in managing, containing, and controlling the disease?


 - 1-7-10 Protocol - used in controlling the spread of ASF in an area known to have the disease infection as supported by laboratory evidence implemented as follows:
     - Quarantine zone - an area set within 1 km radius from infected farm to contain infection by limiting animal movement and employing mandatory test and destruction of all infected animals;
     - Surveillance zone - an area set within 7 km radius intended to detect the extent of the infection thru surveillance activities, disease reporting and limit the movement of live animals, animal products and by-products movement. Every movement outside this zone needs the required documents such as veterinary health certificates and shipping permits; and
     - Control zone - an area set at 10 km radius intended to detect infection at an early stage through mandatory disease reporting.
 - Control measures done in the affected areas: suspected pigs with disease are culled, removed, buried, and disinfected.
 - Disposal of the dead and sick pigs: The team, composed of the Provincial Veterinary Office and Local ASF Task Force, identify the sites, excavate, bury, and then disinfect the burying grounds.
