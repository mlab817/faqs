## What is the NFA’s palay support price at present?


 - The NFA Council, during an emergency meeting held on September 10, 2019 decided to increase the NFA palay support price of PhP 17.00/kg (set in 2008) to PhP 19.00/ kg for clean and dry palay. This is to ensure that farmers selling their palay to NFA will receive a reasonable income from the estimated PhP 12.80/kg production cost of palay produced in the country.
