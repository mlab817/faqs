## What is the level of buffer stock inventory that NFA is mandated to maintain?


 - As prescribed in the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 11203, NFA commissioned an independent study to determine the optimal buffer stock for the agency's mandate.  
 - As per the meetings between the Consulting Team and NFA Council Sub Group, NFA will now adopt an optimal level of rice inventory based on the Maximum Disaster Affected Person-Days. NFA Council approved the results of the study of 300,000 metric tons of rice buffer stock at the national level at any given time. This is equivalent to almost nine (9) days based on the Daily Consumption Requirement (DCR) of 33,564 MT.
