## What are the criteria used in the selection of sites for project implementation as well as the procedure in requesting assistance for the establishment of post-harvest facilities?


 - Foremost is the availability of fishery resources/supply in the area. Demand for the proposed facilities should likewise be established. The proposed site should be relatively peaceful and power and water supplies should be readily available. Presence of good roads and communication network is an advantage.
 - Normally, the proponent sends formal request for construction/improvement of post-harvest facilities. PFDA will then require the proponent to submit fishery profile of their locality for initial evaluation. Based on initial evaluation, PFDA will dispatch a study team to conduct assessment/site validation survey. If warranted, a study team will prepare a feasibility study to determine project viability. Viable projects will then be programmed for implementation.
