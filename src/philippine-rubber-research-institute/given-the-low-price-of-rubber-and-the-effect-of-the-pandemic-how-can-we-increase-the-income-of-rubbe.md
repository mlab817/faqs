# Given the low price of rubber and the effect of the pandemic, how can we increase the income of rubber farmers?


 - Investing in rubber industry through value-adding of rubber products such as production of higher grade of centrifuge latex and rubber sheets to increase the price of rubber products which is needed in in producing condom, tires for vehicles, tires, and medical gloves, among others.
 - For newly planted rubber plants, while rubber is in its immature stage, diversified farming can be applied. Fruit-bearing trees can also be intercropped so that the land becomes more productive. PRRI will conduct massive information campaign on intercropping technique. Through this method, rubber farmers will be able to utilize some other potential parts of their land area for its maximum production.
