## What are available support for rubber farmers that are affected by COVID-19?


 - Introduction of diversified rubber-based farming system where inputs will be provided. This will involve intercropping of other agricultural crops (vegetables, corn, and etc) and integration of livestock (goat and chicken) to provide income to farmers during the immature stage of rubber and especially during this pandemic. It will also distribute quality planting materials for rubber farmers that are willing to plant rubber during this pandemic.
 - Conduct of different training activities that will enhance the capacity of rubber farmers, rubber associations and cooperatives, and coordination with agribusiness sector to support the local farmers in marketing their local products for stronger partnership with public and private sector.
