## How does PCC ensure that the milk delivered is in good quality?


 - PCC makes sure that the raw milk to be produced by the farmers will be handled with good hygienic practices. 
 - PCC offers assistance for milk testing in order to see if the milk is good for production up to delivery. 
 - During delivery, PCC ensures that the milk being delivered is in good quality by making sure that the milk packs are in proper storage and temperature in order to prevent spoilage and by giving samples of milk packs to the authorized inspectors in every drop-off points in order for them to have a sensory evaluation. 
 - During sensory evaluation, the authorized inspectors can taste and smell if the milk is in good quality. They can also inspect if there are any leakage in the milk packs.
