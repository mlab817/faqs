# How can local suppliers/ cooperatives be assured of the contract of the Milk Feeding Program if the mode of procurement is bidding?


 - As a partner of this program, PCC helps and assists our local suppliers/cooperatives with the preparation of legal documents and requirements needed in the bidding process.
 - Consider limited source of bidding as mode of procurement.
 - Community participation, as a form of Negotiated Procurement is allowed in order to meet specific social objectives or for project sustainability. The transactions between the government and third parties such as suppliers will be transparent. 
 - PCC recommends the expansion of coverage to other regions and the amount required for this type of procurement.
