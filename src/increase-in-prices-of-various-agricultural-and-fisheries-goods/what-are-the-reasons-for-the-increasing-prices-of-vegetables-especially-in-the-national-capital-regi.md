### Increase in prices of various agricultural and fisheries goods

## What are the reasons for the increasing prices of vegetables, especially in the National Capital Region (NCR) areas?


 - Supply and demand forces. Factors that negatively affect supply include:
 - Seasonality - Vegetables and other agricultural products in general have biological and seasonal nature of production. Production harvest schedules, volumes and farmgate prices vary by area (province, region, etc.);
 - Perishability - Majority of the agri-fishery products are fresh/raw in form, highly perishable and have relatively shorter shelf-life compared to processed foodstuffs; and
 - Vulnerability to shocks - Agricultural production in the Philippines remain highly vulnerable to weather disturbances and climate changes/conditions (e.g. typhoons, drought, etc.) affecting supply.
 - Factors that affect price directly include:
 - High marketing cost - Complex, duplicating marketing functions and services by several marketing agents handling the products, huge product losses and lack of appropriate market infrastructure and facilities which also affect retail prices received by consumers.
