##### Increase in prices of various agricultural and fisheries goods

## Why does price of local fresh pork remain high?


 - The incidence of African Swine Fever (ASF) in 2019 caused a decline in the domestic supply of hogs in the country resulting to relatively lower marketable volumes of pork carcasses. Hog farms in various production areas in Region III (Central Luzon) and Region IV-A (CALABARZON) temporarily halted their operations while others have permanently discontinued production.
 - Further, the cost of marketing hogs sourced from geographically distant locations, such as in the Visayas and Mindanao as alternative supply sources, was relatively higher compared to usual sources, according to traders.
