## BALIK-PROBINSIYA, BAGONG PAG-ASA (BP2) PROGRAM

# How does DA assist the beneficiaries during the conduct of dispatch operations?


 - The BP2 dispatch operation is being led by the National Housing Authority (NHA), the Secretariat of the BP2 Council. Upon validation of the list of beneficiaries, the NHA coordinates and disseminates the list to all BP2 Program member agencies, including the DA.
 - The DA BP2 Program Office forwards the list of beneficiaries to its Regional Field Offices (RFOs), which then coordinate with the Regional Development Councils (RDCs) and concerned local government units (LGUs) for the provision of support to the beneficiaries.
 - DA RFOs provide gardening kits and seedlings as initial assistance upon the arrival of beneficiaries to their destination provinces. They will then conduct the profiling and assessment of beneficiaries for the provision of support and interventions to those who are interested to pursue agri/fishery business as a means to support their families.
