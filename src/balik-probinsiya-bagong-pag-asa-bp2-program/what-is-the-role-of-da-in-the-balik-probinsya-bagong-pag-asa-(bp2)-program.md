### BALIK-PROBINSIYA, BAGONG PAG-ASA (BP2) PROGRAM

## What is the role of DA in the Balik-Probinsya, Bagong Pag-asa (BP2) Program?


 - The DA, as a member of the BP2 Council, is working to address the program’s key area on Food Security and Agricultural Productivity by empowering BP2 beneficiaries to engage in sustainable rural development, while creating an environment conducive to agri-fishery entrepreneurship, promoting balanced regional development through resilient agro-industrialization.
 - Following EO NO. 114’s key area on Food Security and Agricultural Productivity, the DA is pursuing capacity building, household food sufficiency and livelihood development, collective agri-fishery enterprises, and identification and development of new agi-fishery areas to support the BP2 beneficiaries in particular, and the rural agro-industrial development in general.
 - The DA BP2 Program’s overall objective is to support BP2 beneficiaries who decided to go back to their home provinces for good and to eventually adapt back to provincial life and be successfully reintegrated into their communities.
