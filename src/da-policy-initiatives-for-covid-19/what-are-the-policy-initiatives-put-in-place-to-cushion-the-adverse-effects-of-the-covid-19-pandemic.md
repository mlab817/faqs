##### DA Policy Initiatives for Covid-19

## What are the policy initiatives put in place to cushion the adverse effects of the Covid-19 pandemic including the rising prices of basic food commodities?


 - DA proposed the temporary reduction of pork tariffs and the expansion of the MAV as emergency measures to immediately augment the supply of pork in the country, which in turn was expected to lower and stabilize pork prices. These were to provide consumers access to adequate and affordable food amid the pandemic.
 - These were responded to by the National Government through issuance of Executive Order No. 133, s. 2021 to expand the MAV thru MAV plus, and reduction of pork tariffs through Executive Order No. 134, s. 2021.
 - These measures are on top of the other interventions by DA to arrest the soaring pork prices, which include the hog repopulation program and the Bantay ASF sa Barangay (BABay ASF), as well as the implementation of the suggested retail prices (SRP) on both local and imported pork.
 - The government decided to temporarily reduce the tariff rates on rice, through the issuance of Executive Order No. 135, s. 2021, for the following reasons: 1) keep rice affordable; 2) augment rice supply; 3) diversify sources of rice; and 4) keep rice prices stable and not add to inflationary pressures.
