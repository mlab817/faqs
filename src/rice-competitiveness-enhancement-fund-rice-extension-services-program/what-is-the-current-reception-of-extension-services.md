### Rice Competitiveness Enhancement Fund- Rice Extension Services Program

## What is the current reception of extension services?


 - The RCEF-RESP conducts elicitation of feedback from its stakeholders during information caravans and other Knowledge Sharing and Learning (KSL) activities. 
 - From these activities, the RCEF-RESP found that RCEF interventions are well received in all 57 provinces. 
 - Some farmer-participants expressed some negative sentiments such as low palay price, non-inclusion of their dependents in training activities/scholarships, and rigorous registration to the RSBSA.
 - However, these sentiments are being responded to like the ongoing updating of the RSBSA. TESDA has also considered farmer-dependents to scholarship entitlements.
