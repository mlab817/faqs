# What are the challenges of the corn and cassava industries and the strategies to address these?


 - Low productivity - provision of seeds and planting materials, and fertilizers; strengthen breeding program;  and development of production and postharvest technologies;
 - Minimally organized, aging  population and dominated by  smallholder producers - promote/encourage clustering;
 - Low adoption of improved  technologies - improve extension service delivery; training; and technological demonstration;
 - Inadequate postharvest  facilities and high postharvest losses and low  quality of produce - provision of postharvest machinery and  equipment; and establishment of postharvest facilities;
 - High cost of production and  marketing costs - intensify clustering; and facilitate local market linkages; 
 - Vulnerability to calamities - position seed reserves; establish seed storage facilities; promote appropriate soil conservation measures; and provide appropriate irrigation facilities; and
 - Low income of farmers - training on production technologies, GAP and  product standards and facilitation of GAP certification on farms; increase adoption of improved technologies; and adopt corn integration/diversification with high  value crops, livestock, and poultry.
