# What is NDA's role in the Food Safety Act of 2013?


 - NDA has completed the Dairy Farmer Profiling of all Dairy Business Operators (DBOs) all over the country. Each DBO was assessed and evaluated based on their capacity to comply with the Dairy Safety Regulations (DSR).
 - A total of 1,574 DBOs and their dairy farms were analyzed based on various Dairy Safety Parameters.
 - The Food Safety Team conducted seminar on various dairy safety policies like primary production of raw milk in the dairy farms, post-harvest handling such as transport, storage and processing of raw milk, up to the proper handling of processed milk in the market shelves.
 - The NDA Central Laboratory catered to the needs of the NDA-assisted dairy farmers and other clients on milk testing. Tests conducted include physicochemical tests such as butterfat, protein, pH, titratable acidity and specific gravity/density, microbiological analysis such as Aerobic Plate Count, Coliform Count, and E. coli count and animal health through milk tests such as direct microscopic somatic cell count (DMSSC) and antibiotic residue testing (ART).
 - The product matrix includes raw milk and processed milk such as pasteurized, flavored and fermented milk products.
