# What is the status of NDA’s Milk Feeding Program?


 - The NDA’s milk feeding program is a banner program of the NDA under RA 7884. It aims to address undernutrition in the country while providing market and income opportunities for local dairy farmers and cooperatives.
 - With the passage of RA 11037 or the Masustansiyang Pagkain Para sa Batang Pilipino Act, the milk feeding program was institutionalized to daycare schools (supervised by the DSWD) and elementary public schools (handled by the DepEd). Despite the pandemic, the program is ongoing, with local dairy farmers, cooperatives and producers providing the milk supply.
 - NDA has tapped 62 dairy cooperatives, private farms, SUCs and LGUs as local dairy suppliers and a total of 9,926,952.6 liters of milk were supplied in the Milk Feeding Program, where 972,696 liters of milk were supplied to DSWD and 8,954,256.6 liters of milk were supplied to DepEd.
 - For DSWD, their 10th cycle of the supplemental feeding program (SFP) was  concluded in June 2021, serving a total of 40,529 beneficiaries.
 - For DepEd, the 2020 school-based feeding program (SBFP) implementation is currently ongoing with a total of 1,466,872 beneficiaries.
