# What strategic measures has the NTA adopted to help reduce importation of (blending) tobacco for local manufacturing and increase export of locally-grown leaf tobacco?


 - A continuing dialogue with the local manufacturers and wholesale tobacco dealers is undertaken.  Initial discussions were focused on their assessment of the present crop and for them to define the specific quality they need to substitute a substantial portion of the tobacco that are being imported for domestic manufacturing, identify the issues and concerns  as well as necessary support/ interventions for their effective attainment. Among the immediate measures identified include the following:
 - The adoption of early planting through the Improved Seedling Production project, for the plant to benefit from the remaining moisture and production not to reach the dry/summer months;
 - The use of market-preferred varieties;
 - The mapping/zonification of areas where each type and quality for the above purposes will be grown; and
 - Continuing encouragement towards full adoption of the Tobacco Contract Growing System (TCGS); and, continuing campaign and training of tobacco farmers on the adoption of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP).
