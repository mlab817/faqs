# What are the alternative livelihoods for the ASF-affected farmers?


 - The NLP allotted several alternative livestock multiplier farm modules (cattle, chicken, duck, and other small ruminants) for FY 2022 Tier 1, with a total of PhP 172 million.
 - There are other programs that allow the ASF-affected farmers to venture into swine livelihood such as the sentinel program, which is part of the calibrated repopulation component of INSPIRE. For FY 2022, the DA is proposing PhP 892 million in Tier 2 for the sentinel program.
