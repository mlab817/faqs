# What is Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) and Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for the Philippine Fisheries?


 - MSY is the largest average quantity of fish that can be harvested from a  fish stocks/ resource within a period of time (e.g. one year) on a sustainable basis under existing environmental conditions, while TAC is defined as the maximum harvest allowed to be taken during a given period of time from any fishery area or from any fishery species, or a combination of area and species and normally would not exceed the MSY (Sections 61 and 85, RA8550 as amended by RA10654). 
 - TAC computation is not applicable in the Philippine fisheries because it is commonly used in areas with single species and gear which is different from our countryâ€™s fisheries situation wherein various fishing gears are used to catch various fish species.
 - MSY is recommended for Philippines to determine the status of capture fisheries. To get MSY, a total inventory of boat and gear is necessary.
