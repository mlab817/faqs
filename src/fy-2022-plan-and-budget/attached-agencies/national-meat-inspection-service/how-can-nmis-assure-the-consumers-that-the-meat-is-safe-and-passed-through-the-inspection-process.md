# How can NMIS assure the consumers that the meat is safe and passed through the inspection process?


 - Meat that came from accredited sources and passed through the inspection process of NMIS are certified fit for human consumption by meat inspection officers through the Meat and Meat Products Inspection Certificate or MMPIC. Carcasses also bear the marks of inspection. Processed meats must also bear a label on their packaging to indicate the source and other mandatory information such as product name, net quantity, ingredients, and safe handling instructions.
