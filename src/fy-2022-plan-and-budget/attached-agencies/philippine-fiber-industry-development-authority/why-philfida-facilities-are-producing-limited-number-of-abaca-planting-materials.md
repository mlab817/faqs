# Why PhilFIDA facilities are producing limited number of abaca planting materials?


 - The PhilFIDA Facilities cannot produce the planting materials needed by the farmers due to lack of fund to hire personnel and procure the necessary equipment and materials (e.g., chemicals, agricultural supplies) needed for the production of planting materials.
