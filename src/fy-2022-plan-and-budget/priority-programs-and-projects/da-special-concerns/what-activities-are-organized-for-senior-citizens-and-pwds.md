# What activities are organized for Senior Citizens and PWDs?


 - The OUSC and concerned DA-Committees provide webinars/online trainings for SC and PWD employees such as Urban Gardening, Health and Wellness program, Disaster Preparedness Activities and Livelihood programs. All these activities are in partnership with other National Agencies and Local Government Units. This is to ensure the rights and welfare of SCs and PWDs are respected, protected and promoted.
