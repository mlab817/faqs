# What are the major programs of the DA for the Youth?


 - Mentoring and Attracting Youth in Agribusiness (MAYA) Program - Overseen by the Bureau of Agricultural Research (BAR), this is a three month internship aimed to develop competent, highly-skilled and employment-ready youthful workforce. Through experiential learning, it seeks to level-up the agriculture sector beyond its production-focused orientation, and progressively expand to the entire gamut of input production, farm operations and management, equipment and supplies manufacturing, food/non-food processing, marketing, trading and retailing. 
 - Kapital Access for Young Agripreneurs (KAYA) – a loan program implemented by the Agricultural Credit Policy Council (ACPC) that aims to attract young generation farmers and fishers. The program supports start-ups or existing farm/fishery business. It targets qualified “yaggies” (young agripreneurs) 18-30 years old who are engaged in farming/fishing, loans are interest-free (0%).
 - Agricultural Competitiveness Enhancement Fund (ACEF) – Grants-In-Aid For Higher Education Program (GIAHEP) – provides a comprehensive and attractive grants-in-aid program to contribute to the development of agriculture and fisheries by increasing the number of graduates in higher education who are trained in the scientific habit of thought, entrepreneurial skills and technical competencies in the areas of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, veterinary medicine education and related agricultural education programs. 
 - Other Training Programs (ATI):
 - Youth Agripreneurship Trainings;
 - Youth Internship Program in Taiwan;
 - Young Filipino Farmer Leaders Training Program in Japan;
 - 4-H Club Youth Development Program; and
