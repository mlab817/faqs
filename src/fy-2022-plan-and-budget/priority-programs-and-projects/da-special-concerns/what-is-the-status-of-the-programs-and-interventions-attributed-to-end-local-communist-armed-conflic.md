## DA Special Concerns

# What is the status of the programs and interventions attributed to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (ELCAC)?


 - The DA is actively participating on sub clusters under the NTF-ELCAC: Sectoral Unification, Capacity Building, Empowerment and Mobilization Cluster (SUCBEM); Enhanced Comprehensive Local Integration Program (E-CLIP); and the Poverty Reduction Livelihood and Employment Cluster (PRLEC).
 - For FY 2020, DA had given agricultural interventions to at least 1,817 individuals.
 - There were 39 Barangays served as of the 1st Quarter of 2021 by the Department under the 822 Barangays for Priority Development as identified by the ELCAC. It should be noted also that the number of barangays given interventions under the list of Communist Terrorist Group Affected and Threatened per DA RFOs were 596 as of August 2021.
 - DA RFOs have been continuously distributing Agricultural inputs, machineries, Cash and Food Subsidy for Marginal Farmers & Fisher folks (CFSMFF) and conducting livelihood training from the different banner programs of the DA.
