# What is the Bayanihan Agri-Clusters (BACs)?


 - The Bayanihan Agri-Clusters or DA-F2C2 program was created on August 05, 2020 through DA Administrative Order 27, S.2020 which seeks to advance the interest and condition of Filipino small farmers and fisheries by encouraging them to adopt the strategy of clustering and consolidation of their production, processing and marketing activities as community business enterprises, including the pooling of assets, labor and other resources, in order to, among others:
 - Effectively achieve and benefit from economies of scale in commodity production;
 - Forge stronger linkages among farm and fish producers to their commodity’s markets and the bigger global value chain;
 - Establish better access to sources of credit and financing and investments, and as well better access to domestic and export markets; and
 - Encourage active “Big Brother-Small Brother” partnerships, joint ventures, and contract growing arrangements between Farmers Cooperatives and Associations (FCAs) and the much larger corporate enterprises and attract more private investments towards at the agriculture sector.
