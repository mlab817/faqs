# Why is the program not expanding/covering more provinces (from the 30 provinces)?


 - SAAD Program focuses on 30 provinces to help assure the success of its implementation given project financial and administrative constraints. The said 30 provinces were the target agreed upon with the DBM and additional provinces may only be covered under Tier 2. However, expansion can also be done in 2023, if the SAAD gets an extension.
