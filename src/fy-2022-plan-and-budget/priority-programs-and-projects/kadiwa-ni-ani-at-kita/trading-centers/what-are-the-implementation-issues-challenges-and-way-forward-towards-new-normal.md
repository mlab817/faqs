## Trading Centers

# What are the implementation issues, challenges and way forward towards new normal?


 - The trading centers complement with the DA’s KADIWA ni Ani at Kita program through market linkage activities.
 - Farmer-suppliers (farmers, cooperatives and associations) selling in the trading centers also participate in the different KADIWA ni Ani at Kita modalities.
 - In fact, products from trading centers are showcased whenever there are KADIWA launching and this collaboration is continuous.
 - Lack of “buy-in” of farmers to use the facilities of the trading centers due to the traditional credit-tie up with traders or middlemen. To address this, farmer beneficiaries of the trading centers are linked to banner programs for production support and the the credit programs of the Agricultural Credit Policy Council (ACPC), e.g. the SURE-AID Program.
 - Seasonal operation of municipal/provincial-based trading centers. This is aggravated by disasters, calamities and hazards. In the case of the livestock “oksyon” market, peak operating day is only during “market day”, which happens usually once a week.
 - COVID-19 pandemic which resulted to intermittent operation and, in worst case, closure of operations. In this case, farmer cooperatives and associations (FCAs) covered by the trading centers are linked with the regional and national KADIWA ni Ani at Kita program to provide alternative markets.
