## Stimulating the Agriculture and Fisheries Enterprises Ecosystem (SAFE) Program

# What is the program all about?


 - Stimulating the Agriculture and Fisheries Enterprise Ecosystem (SAFE) aims to serve as a bridging platform that will mobilize and engage a multitude of actors particularly from the knowledge and education regime, which includes agricultural research centers, higher educational institutions, and the public/private extension system (supply side) with the business and enterprise sector (demand side) to commercialize technologies that will make high-value agricultural commodities competitive, i.e. exploit knowledge-based resources to create value-adding products and services to increase success level of agri-preneurs as they are mainstreamed into the value chain.
