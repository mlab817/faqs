## National Convergence Initiative

# Where does NCI-SRD get funding?


 - NCI-SRD as a government strategy (and not program), does not have a dedicated budget but utilizes existing funds of the programs  of the four (4) Departments. Accomplishments, both physical and financial targets, are based on attribution.
 - The NCI-SRD Bill already approved on its third and final reading at the House of Representatives, if passed in to law, shall be a solid legal basis of the mechanism and funding for projects, regardless of administration and political situation. With the institutionalization of the convergence strategy, harmonization of policies and complementation of resources are ensured in the countryside all over the country.
