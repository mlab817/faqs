# What is the status of GM technologies that are in the regulatory pipeline (i.e., Golden Rice and Bt eggplant)?


 - Golden Rice. Among other options, genetic engineering or modification was used to address this problem through rice – a staple Filipino food. The Food, Feed and Processing (FFP) and field trials have been completed in 2019. The multi-location field trials were conducted in Science City of Muñoz, Nueva Ecija, and San Mateo, Isabela. Just recently the biosafety permit for commercial propagation of Golden Rice has been issued to the DA-Philippine Rice Research Institute (DA-PhilRice) on July 2021.
 - Bt Eggplant. The Bt eggplant is developed to address the problems on yield losses and decrease exposure of farmers and consumers from the hazards of massive spraying of chemical insecticides as well as its environmental risks. To date, the technology developers of Bt eggplant have just received the biosafety permit for direct use of the crop as FFP and preparations are in progress for the application for propagation as well as FPA Plant-Incorporated Protectant registration.
 - Bt Cotton. To date, the DA Biotech Program, through a Technical Advisory Group (TAG) composed of experts, is assisting PhilFIDA to move forward until the completion of the regulatory process. So far, the intellectual property agreements for any legal impediments in the use of acquired Bt cotton hybrids for the development of a local breeding program are being reviewed by the members of the TAG.
