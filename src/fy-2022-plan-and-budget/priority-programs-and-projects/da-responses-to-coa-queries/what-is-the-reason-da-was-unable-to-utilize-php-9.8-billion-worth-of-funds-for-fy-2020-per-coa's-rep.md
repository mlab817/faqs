## DA Responses to COA Queries

# What is the reason DA was unable to utilize PhP 9.8 billion worth of funds for FY 2020 per COA’s report?


 - As mentioned in the audit observations, the major cause of low utilization of cash was mainly due to the restrictions and health protocols brought about by the pandemic that greatly affected the movement of goods and laborers as well as materials in the construction and manufacturing. DA was also greatly affected by these lockdown measures.
 - Note that only a portion of the PhP 9.8 billion was reverted to the National Treasury broken down as follows:
 - Purpose of NCA
 - Balance (Php Millions)
 - Justifications
 - Implementation of RRP 1 Under Bayanihan I
 - 3,250
 - Failure of bidding of procurement of seeds, fertilizers and other inputs
 - Bayanihan II Projects under DA-OSEC
 - 601
 - Delay in the implementation and erroneous crediting of Notice of Cash Allocation (CA)
 - Quick Response Fund (QRF)
 - 710
 - Failure of bidding and difficulty in implementation due to pandemic
 - Agricultural Competitiveness Enhancement Fund (ACEF)
 - 181
 - Attributed to delay in the perfection of MOA with Implementing Agencies on the implementation of Research
 - It should be also noted that the amount accounted for PRDP of around PhP 3.9 billion will not revert to the National Treasury since these are accounts deposited outside the Treasury Single Account implemented by the National Government and represents the 2021 Q1 and Q2 forecast, which is allowed by World Bank.
