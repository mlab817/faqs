## DA Responses to COA Queries

# What is the reason for the PhP 17.5 billion unliquidated fund transfers and cash advances to agencies, local government units, government-controlled corporations and non-government organizations in 2020 per COA’s report?


 - The DA experienced difficulty enforcing the submission of duly signed documentation, which is required for liquidation, due to the pandemic.
 - The implementation of the projects by IAs have also been affected by the pandemic; hence, the delay that is most notable in Philippine Rural Development Project (PRDP)-funded projects. 
 - Around PhP 4.9 billion of the remaining balance is attributable to the implementation of Bayanihan II wherein the funding was released only in the last quarter of 2020. 
 - The liquidation documents of balances of Fund Transfer for some programs like the Financial Subsidy to Rice Farmers (PhP 461.9 million) and Rice Farmers Financial Assistance (PhP 2.953 billion) are being scrutinized to ensure no duplication of beneficiaries. 
 - The DA is closely monitoring the implementation of these projects and its full liquidation. Around PhP 3.9 billion additional liquidations were recorded in DA’s books from the time the report was made.
