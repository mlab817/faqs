# What is the contribution of the DA-BAFS in the implementation of the Food Safety Act?


 - As of August 2021, the Bureau has developed a total of 134 food-safety PNS for primary and postharvest foods. These food safety standards can be broken down into crops (73 PNS), livestock and poultry (19 PNS), fish and fishery (34 PNS), and general standards (8 PNS). The said PNS were approved by the DA Secretary and endorsed to the mandated Food Safety Regulatory Agencies (FSRAs) for possible adoption or basis of their respective technical regulations.
 - Also, in 2017, the DC No. 02 Series of 2017 or the Guidelines on the Creation of the DA Pool of Scientific Experts (DAPE) and the Issuance of Scientific or Technical Recommendations was issued in compliance with Section 16 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the Food Safety Act of 2013. The Act mandated BAFS to organize the DAPE to support the development of food safety standards and provide scientific advice.
