# What are the new mandates of BAFS as per Republic Act No. 11511 (An Act Amending the Republic Act No. 10068 or the Organic Agriculture Act of 2010)?


 - Develop standards on organic agriculture;
 - Accredit organic certifying bodies (OCB), which covers both third party OCBs and Participatory Guarantee System (PGS) groups (which intends to address the issue of high certification cost); and
 - Register integrated organic farms and organic inputs (soil amendments and bio-control agents).
 - In this regard, as of July 30, 2021, the DA-BAFS has developed 7 Organic Agriculture Standards which are the following: Organic Agriculture, Organic Milled Rice - Code of Practice - Postproduction, Organic Aquaculture, Organic biocontrol agents – Microbials and botanicals – Minimum data requirements, Organic Soil Amendments (formerly Organic Fertilizer), Organic Aquaculture Feeds, and Code of Practice for the Production of Organic Soil Amendments
