# What is the reason for 67 DA Projects funded through ODA that are beyond target date of completion per COA’s report?


 - The Philippine Rural Development Project (PRDP) has instituted measures to catch-up with the delays and has put in place strategies enabling expeditious work to ongoing PRDP subprojects. Of the 21 delayed I-BUILD subprojects, 14 subprojects are already completed with an amount of PhP 938.42 million while two (2) ongoing subprojects have positive variance against their target accomplishment. Contractors were required to submit catch-up plans.
 - As of June 2021, I-BUILD physical and financial progress stand at 94% and 88%, respectively at 81% time elapsed under the original loan (OL). While at 67% time elapsed of first additional financing (AF1), the I-BUILD has so far attained 76% physical and 78% financial accomplishments. 
 - Hence, PRDP is advanced both in physical and financial performance against the time elapsed of OL and AF1.
 - For the I-REAP subprojects, PRDP prepared a recovery/action plan in coordination with the concerned LGUs and Proponent Groups (PGs) to ensure sustainability of completed subprojects. Moreover, a completion catch-up plan has been prepared in order to catch-up disbursement and completion of ongoing subprojects. The PSOs/RPCOs are continuously monitoring and tracking the progress as well as providing technical assistance to the LGUs to ensure completion and operationalization of all subprojects. 
 - As of September 2021, there are already 469 completed subprojects, of which 42 were completed within January to August 2021.
 - The PRDP was granted a two-year extension for both OL and AF-1 to complete physical implementation until December 2022.
