##### DA Responses to COA Queries

## What is the reason for the 7,146 duplicate names submitted by the DA to the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP), resulting in the over-remittance of financial subsidies and food assistance amounting to PhP 35.8 million per COA’s report?


 - For the farmer’s duplicate records and overpayments, the implementation of the project and programs concerned were still ongoing at the time the audit was made. The matters on duplicate records resulting in overpayments were properly addressed. 
 - The DA, in constant coordination with the Government Financial Institution, placed corrective actions which include cancellation of claims of duplicate farmers and replacing them with other beneficiaries, among others.
