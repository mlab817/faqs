### DA Responses to COA Queries

## What are the reasons and actions taken for PhP 368.96 million worth of DA cash advances that were not liquidated in accordance with regulations per COA’s report?


 - Demand letters are continuously being sent to accountable officers to liquidate cash advances despite the observance of alternative work arrangements in the agency.
 - No additional cash advances are being granted to officers who have not liquidated their previous cash advances and it just so happen that liquidation requires submission of supporting documents that are at least at par with the requirements mandated by existing rules and regulations and the same are not easy to comply when health protocols are being implemented in the workplace.
 - It should be noted that the most of the documents must submitted in a form acceptable to COA, like original receipts and invoices. Movement of which are restricted by health protocols. 
 - As of August 20, 2021, DA collected updates from its Operating Units that the balance reported by COA that appears to be unliquidated have decreased by P334.5 Million.
