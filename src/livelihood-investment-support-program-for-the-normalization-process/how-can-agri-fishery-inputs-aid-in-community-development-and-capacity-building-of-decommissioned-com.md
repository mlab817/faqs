## How can agri-fishery inputs aid in community development and capacity building of decommissioned combatants?


 - Decommissioned combatants are mostly small scale agri-preneurs. They conduct basic agricultural practices, which lacks technological advancement. To efficiently provide support, we must provide agri-fishery inputs and machineries, which will kick start development of capacity building and develop a sense of community that is disparate from a life style of violent extremism.
