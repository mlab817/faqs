# What steps has SRA undertaken in order to address the burden of submitting voluminous requirements, and slow processing and approval of loans?


 - The implementation of the Socialized Credit Program (SCP) has greatly improved through the partnership with the Landbank of the Philippines (LBP), which can be backed up by the program's utilization rate and the amount of pending loan applications awaiting the availability of funds. 
 - SRA and LBP are currently undertaking steps to possibly use accredited farmers associations/cooperatives as loan conduits, which can make the program more accessible to the farmers and for the loan processing and  approval to be faster and more efficient.
