# How will the Supreme Court Ruling on the Mandanas-Garcia Case affect the implementation of the SIDA Programs?


 - No functions of SRA were devolved to the Local Government Units; hence, the implementation of the SIDA programs remains with the SRA units. 
 - Operations at the local level are being handled by the Mill District Officers of SRA.
