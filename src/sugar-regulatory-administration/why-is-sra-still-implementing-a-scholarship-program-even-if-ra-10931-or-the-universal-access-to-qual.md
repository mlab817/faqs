### Sugar Regulatory Administration

## Why is SRA still implementing a scholarship program even if RA 10931 or the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act is already being implemented?


 - The SIDA Scholarship Program under SRA specifically aims to augment the shortage of professionals/technical personnel in the sugarcane industry and covers degree programs in relevant field of discipline, while also prioritizing underprivileged students who are dependents of the sugarcane industry. 
 - Furthermore, the Scholarship Program also includes provisions for stipend, book, and thesis/dissertation allowance, which are not covered by RA 10931.
