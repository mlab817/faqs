### Avian Influenza (AI)

## What is the current status of Avian Influenza (AI) in the country?


 - There were three (3) cases of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) Type A H5N6 in the Philippines in 2020 confirmed through laboratory tests conducted in the Bureau of Animal Industry â€“ Animal Disease Diagnosis and Reference Laboratory (BAI-ADDRL):
 - The places and species affected are the following:
 - Commercial Farm in Jaen, Nueva Ecija affecting 15,000 quails (March 2020);
 - Commercial Farm in San Luis, Pampanga affecting approx. 40,000-layer (table egg) chickens (July 2020); and
 - Backyard Farm in Taytay, Rizal affecting 500 heads free range chicken, 300 heads Muscovy ducks (September 2020).
 - Surveillance activities (1-km and 7km radius) were also done in the affected and surrounding barangays or municipalities with susceptible avian population, along with trace back and trace forward investigations. Samples collected were tested in the BAI-ADDRL and yielded NEGATIVE results for HPAI Type A H5N6.
 - Since then, there have been no reported suspect cases of HPAI Type A H5N6 for more than three (3) months after each case has been managed; thus, several countries have recognized our local declaration of resolution of these cases and resumed trade explorations, especially in relation to Philippine poultry and poultry products.
