## What is the National Stock Assessment Program (NSAP)?


 - NSAP is a Program that conducts assessment of major pelagic (fish that inhabits in the upper layer of the open sea) and demersal (fish that inhabits in the bottom layer of the open sea) species in major fishing grounds of the county through establishment of standardized time series and biological data. Through stock assessment, Reference Point (RP) can be established.
 - RP is defined as benchmark values often based on indicators such as fishery stock size or the level of fishing that serves as standard to compare estimates of a fishery stock size and fishing mortality over time depending on the biological characteristics of the species. Based on RP, Harvest Control Rules (HCR) may be recommended in a particular body of water.
 - HCR refers to actions or set of actions to be taken to achieve a medium or long term target reference point while avoiding reaching or breaching a limit reference point (Section 54, RA8550 as amended by RA10654). It can contribute in ensuring a sustainable supply of fish.
