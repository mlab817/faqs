## What is the relationship of National Stock Assessment Program (NSAP) to the establishment of Fisheries Management Areas (FMAs) in the country?


 - The NFRDI plays a critical role in providing science-based information needed for each Fisheries Management Area. The 12 FMAs were established based on considerations of stocks boundary/range/ distribution, structure of fisheries as well as administrative divisions (Fisheries Administrative Order No. 263, s. 2019).
 - Through the NSAP, it will assist each FMA in identifying the key species found within the FMA in establishing the Reference Points. Based on this reference points, NFRDI and the NSAP teams at the regional levels may recommend Harvest Control Rules and other related actions to the Science Advisory Group (SAG) for its use as inputs in formulating conservation and management measures.
 - At present, FMAs have formed their Management Board (MB) and are in various stages of completing their individual SAG. Determination of key species per FMA (including consolidation of catch and effort information by concerned regions) and continuous gathering of information for the update of their FMA  Profile among others, are the current activities being undertaken.
