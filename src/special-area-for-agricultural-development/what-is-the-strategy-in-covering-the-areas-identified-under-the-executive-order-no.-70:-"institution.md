### Special Area for Agricultural Development

## What is the strategy in covering the areas identified under the Executive Order No. 70: “Institutionalizing the Whole-of-Nation Approach in Attaining Inclusive and Sustainable Peace, Creating a National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict, and Directing the Adoption of a National Peace Framework”?


 - SAAD will cover EO 70 areas within its 27 covered provinces as proposed in FY 2022 under Tier 2. It is projected to cover 670 barangays providing 109 livelihood projects amounting to PhP 489 million. The strategy is for the selected beneficiaries within the area to undergo social preparation (needs assessment and capability building activities) and receive livelihood interventions. 
 - The remaining three (3) SAAD-identified provinces (Sulu, Siquijor and Lanao del Sur) were not included in the EO 70 priority areas.
