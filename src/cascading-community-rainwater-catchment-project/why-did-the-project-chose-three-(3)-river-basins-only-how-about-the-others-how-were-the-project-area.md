### Cascading Community Rainwater Catchment Project

## Why did the project chose three (3) river basins only? How about the others? How were the project areas selected?


 - Project sites were identified based on the following set of criteria: 
 - Target sites are rainfed and upland areas not covered by the National Irrigation Administration and without an existing or functioning irrigation system.
 - Presence of built-up areas as well as agricultural or fishery activities in the area. 
 - If former criteria are not applicable, target areas are considered as expansion for agricultural development based on Network of Protected Areas for Agricultural and Agro-Industrial Development (NPAAAD) and Strategic Agriculture and Fisheries Development Zone (SAFDZ). 
 - Suitable sites for small scale irrigation systems based on BSWM master plan.
 - Willingness of LGUs, farmers and residents to provide counterpart or share in the construction of RWCS. 
 - Occurrence of destructive flooding downstream of the macro watersheds.
