# What are the effects of COVID-19 to the rubber industry?


 - Lower price or raw rubber products (cuplumps) was observed as demand for processing have decreased dramatically due to transportation and delivery issues brought about by Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) and General Community Quarantine (GCQ). 
 - Due to the unavailability of tappers, some plantations refused to tap their trees to obtain cuplumps which affected the supply. 
 - Some of the processing plants locally sourcing cuplumps from other plantations for processing end up exporting their own cuplumps instead of turning them first into rubber sheets.
