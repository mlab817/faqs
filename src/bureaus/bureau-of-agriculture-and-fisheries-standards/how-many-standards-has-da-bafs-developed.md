# How many standards has DA-BAFS developed?


 - BAFS has developed a total number of 312 Philippine National Standard (PNS) for agriculture and fishery (A&F) products,  tools, machinery,  equipment, and structures since 2003. Majority of the PNS are related to crops for food and non-food (49.4%), followed by agriculture and fishery (AF) tools, machinery, equipment, and structures (21.6%), fish and fishery products (12.3%) and livestock and poultry products (10.3%). More than half or 57.4% of these PNS are quality standards and the rest are food safety standards (42.6%). 
 - As of July 2021, 94% (68 out of the 72) ASEAN regional standards related to AF primary and postharvest products are already adopted as PNS. For Codex standards within the mandates of DA-BAFS, 36% (44 out 123) have already been adopted.
 - Currently, out of the 312 total PNS, 46 (15%) have corresponding technical regulations from relevant regulatory agencies. Eleven (11) are food quality standards whilst 35 are food safety related standards.
 - For FY 2022, BAFS will develop 20 Philippine National Standards (PNS) classified as food safety- or food quality-related PNS.
