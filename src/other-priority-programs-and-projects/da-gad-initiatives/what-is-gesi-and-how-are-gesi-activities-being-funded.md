# What is GESI and how are GESI Activities being funded?


 - GESI stands for Gender Equality and Social Inclusion. It is a concept that addresses unequal power relations experienced by people on the grounds of gender, wealth, ability, location, caste/ethnicity, language, and agency or a combination of these dimensions. 
 - With the creation of the GESI Program in the DA, the issues of women in agriculture, including those in the vulnerable sectors namely: Senior Citizens (SCs), Differently Abled Persons (DAPs) and Indigenous Peoples (IPs) are being addressed. They are now being considered in the planning and targeting of participants and beneficiaries of DA’s Programs and Projects for them to have access to services that will help them become agripreneurs and ultimately achieve women economic empowerment (WEE).
 - The budget for GAD and DAPs is being sourced from the 5% and 1 % of the DA’s total budget, respectively, according to the GAA and other related laws and regulations.
