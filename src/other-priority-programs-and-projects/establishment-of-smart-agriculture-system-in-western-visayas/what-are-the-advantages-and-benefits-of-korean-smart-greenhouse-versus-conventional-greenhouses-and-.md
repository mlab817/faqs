# What are the advantages and benefits of Korean Smart Greenhouse versus conventional greenhouses and open field production?


 - Smart farm or greenhouse is an ICT-based smart greenhouse system in horticulture controls the growth environment of crops inside the greenhouse, thus increases crop production and supply stability through the automation of farm.
 - The Smart Greenhouse is more advanced in technology compared to the Conventional Greenhouses in terms of monitoring the pest and disease infestation, nutrient and water deficiency, and temperature regulation. In addition, the Smart Greenhouse is more precise in its recommendation and does not require manual labor in watering, fertilizing, nor spraying of pests and diseases.  
 - Compared to on-farm production, the Smart Greenhouse production can be off-season thus ensuring availability of produce most of the time, way more manageable and advanced in terms of disease and pest control, better physical quality of produce, and energy conserving (manpower, inputs, water).
