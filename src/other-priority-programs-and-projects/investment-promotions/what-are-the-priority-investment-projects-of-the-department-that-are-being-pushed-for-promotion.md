# What are the priority investment projects of the Department that are being pushed for promotion?


 - The priority investment projects of the DA for promotion are the Regional Priority Commodities and those commodities that are anchored to the Priority Commodity Investment Plans (PCIPs).
 - The PCIP is a strategic plan that rationalizes the interventions within the various segments of the value chain of commodities that are of significance to the province and that will contribute to the national goals of the agriculture and fishery sector. It is a 3-year rolling consensus plan between the DA and PLGU based on the value chain analyses of these commodities conducted with strong participation of the various stakeholders.
