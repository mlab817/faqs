# How is the coordinative function of the Area Development Program Office (ADPO) beneficial to agro-industrial development of SOCCSKSARGEN?


 - ADPOâ€™s coordinative role helps in the integration and harmonization of agri-industrial plans and programs in the region, through interagency/LGU coordination, consultative planning, joint monitoring and evaluation, and management and resolution of intra-regional and inter-LGU development issues and conflicts, mindful of environment and resource sustainability, with the inclusion and active participation of Private Sector, Academe and Industry & Farmer Groups.
