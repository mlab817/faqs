# If the MAV allocation is not consumed in full, what may be the reasons given that they should be cheaper than the regular importation?


 - A licenseeâ€™s utilization of its allocation is their prerogative or business decision.  The MAV secretariat does not ask the reason for not fully utilizing their allocation. 
 - However they are are informed of the penalties for underutilization as provided for in Section 1, H. 2. of MMC AO 1 series of 1998 as amended by MMC AO 52 s. of 2000.
