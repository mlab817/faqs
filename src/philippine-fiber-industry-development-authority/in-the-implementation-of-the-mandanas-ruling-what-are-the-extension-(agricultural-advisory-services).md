# In the implementation of the Mandanas Ruling, what are the extension (agricultural advisory services) functions that need to be strengthened by the LGUs?


 - One of the functions of the LGUs which needs to be strengthened is the establishment and maintenance of the fibercrop nurseries at the municipal/barangay level thru the transfer of technologies by PhilFIDA to the concerned LGUs.
