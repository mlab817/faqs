# How will you help the local dairy farmers increase their productivity and profitability?


 - Successful dairy farmers were observed to be those who are open- minded, decisive, well-driven and resilient. These characteristics were both inherent and developed. The government has put in- place the enabling environment to help them achieve their maximum potentials in terms of productivity and profitability.
 - The key strategies identified to attain this are as follows:
 - Give the options to choose and access the latest genetic technologies in the production of dairy animals;
 - Infuse more productive dairy animals through importation; and
 - Propagate good feeding practices; develop, produce & distribute inexpensive but effective TMR (Total Mixed Ration) formulation.
