## What are the challenges encountered in implementation?


 - Challenges include restrictions brought about by the pandemic and difficulties in procurement, especially the use of public bidding to procure from local dairy farmers and cooperatives. Local farmers and cooperatives are having a hard time complying the stringent requirements for a PhilGEPS Platinum. For this purpose, we are still waiting for the direct procurement modality under the Sagip Saka Act.
