### Rice Competitiveness Enhancement Fund (RCEF)

## What are the key findings from the rapid assessment made on RCEF?


 - The key findings are as follows: 
 - Fragmentation of RCEF Program M&E system reflects lack of integration and synergy among the four (4) program components;
 - Good M&E practices, underpinned by strong research orientation, are present as exhibited by PhilRice; and
 - Rice farmers and their FCAs can be more than just passive recipients of program interventions, rather they can participate more actively in the conduct of M&E activities.
 - These key findings are being addressed by the RCEF program through the following solutions: (1) the RCEF will devise a unified data capture form for monitoring and evaluation; (2) PhilRice will share its M&E practices and support the other IAs in developing its own M&E system; and (3) beneficiaries will be more involved in data gathering for M&E.
 - RCEF is being assisted by FAO for the establishment of the RCEF-Impact Monitoring System that will be used as an M&E tool on the upcoming 3rd year program evaluation.
