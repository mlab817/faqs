## What is the status of monetization and utilization of the 2KR Program as of June 30, 2021?


 - As of June 2021, the 2KR Program has a fund balance of PhP 47,350,298 for agri & fishery projects. However, there are still funds reverted to the Bureau of the Treasury which is from the unexpended balances of approved completed/terminated projects, and remittances from the Farm Level Grains Center (FLGC) project and the Special Vehicle Loan Fund (SVLF) which were terminated as a result of the rationalization. 
 - The PCAF is currently working on the reconciliation of the 2KR Program fund balances to comply with the requirements on the approval of proposed projects under the said program. The available and reconciled 2KR program funds will be used for the benefit for underprivileged farmers through the aforementioned project.
 - Currently, ongoing project funded by 2KR program consist of BPI's Strengthening of the National Pesticide Analytical Laboratory amounting to PhP 57 million, and BAI and AMAS's Rehabilitation and Modernization of Livestock “Oksyon” Markets in the Philippines amounting to PhP 33.91 million.
