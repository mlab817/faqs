## What is the Japan 2KR?


 - The Japan 2KR, officially known as the Japan Grant Assistance for the Food Security Project for Underprivileged Farmers, is a commodity assistance program from the Government of Japan (GOJ).  It is a form of bilateral Official Development Assistance (ODA) without the obligation of repayment.  The purpose of the program is to support the independent efforts of recipient developing countries to improve the production of staple foods such as rice, corn, and wheat.  The program extends agricultural commodity grants that are necessary in the implementation of projects that will promote increased food production including fertilizers, agricultural chemicals, and agricultural machinery and equipment.  The Philippines has been a recipient of the 2KR Program from 1977 to 2010.
