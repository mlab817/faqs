# What is the purpose of PL480?


 - PL480 is the main legislative vehicle that authorizes U.S. international food assistance. This was enacted in 1954 in line with the US Policy of using its agricultural productivity to enhance the food security of developing countries and the determination of the importing countryâ€™s capacity of improving its food security.
 - The PL480 provides for government-to-government sale on credit of US commodities under long-term, concessional arrangement.  U.S. commodities are shipped to recipient countries either for direct use in food distribution programs or for mechanization in recipient country markets.  Payment of the commodities is expected over 30 years with a grace period of up to five years. The local currency derived from such concessional sales is used to support specific non-emergency food security and development projects of the recipient government.
