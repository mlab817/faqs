# Given the COVID-19 pandemic, how can ATI push through in achieving its vision, mission and goals?


 - Realignment of funds intended for big group trainings, conferences, exhibition activities to basic production inputs for crops (provision of seeds, soil ameliorant, assorted hand tools, and small equipment) and livestock (provision of small animals, feeds, feed-related inputs and biologics).
 - Adoption of a blended learning approach through the following: use of other computer-based and radio-based learning platforms such as School on the Air (SOA) and the use of social media sites; registration to AF e-Learning courses through the ATI e-extension website;  supplementation of appropriate and localized IEC materials; and compressed number of days for hands-on activities.
 - Strict observance of physical distancing and wearing of PPEs for activities requiring face-to-face interactions.
 - Intensification of provision of extension support in the form of starter kits to the beneficiaries of ATI conducted/initiated training and other related activities.
 - Dissemination of information through different media platforms like radio, television, and the internet. Printed media is used in areas where internet and radio connectivity is limited.
