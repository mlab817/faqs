# What programs, projects, and activities (PPAs) of the ATI will directly and/or indirectly address the effects of the pandemic?


 - Among the programs that are being implemented and promoted by the Institute are the Urban Agriculture Program (UAP), Backyard/household gardening of edibles, and Community farming. These aim to secure food for every Filipino household and encourage households to produce their own food and use it for their consumption. The ATI provides starter kits to households/ individuals in the urban and peri-urban areas nationwide. The starter kits contain IEC materials, assorted seeds and seedlings, garden soil, vermicast, poly bags, and seedling tray.
