##### SOCSKSARGEN Area Development Project

## What are the contribution to Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies?


 - ADPO promotes planting of bamboos along critical riverbanks through the Riverbank Rehabilitation Project in SOCCSKSARGEN, in support to Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation. Bamboos stabilize the riverbanks and slopes and mitigate the damage caused by flash floods to nearby agricultural areas. The project will also support future livelihood/cottage industry projects and food production, thus maximizing the use of government resources.
 - The Riverbank Rehabilitation Project under ADPO covers the period 2016-2022 (except 2017). A total of 738,552 bamboos was distributed and planted covering 926 kms of riverbanks in 232 barangays in Region XII as of date. A total of 360,000 bamboo seedlings will be added for the region in FY 2022 amounting to PhP 9.0 million.
