# How do these operational trading centers complement with the DA’s “KADIWA ni Ani at Kita” program?


 - As of June 2021, there are 26 APTCs nationwide at various stages of implementation: 
 - a) 12 operational APTCs; 
 - b) 6 not operational (due to the covid-19 pandemic, lack of trading capital, among others); 
 - c) 4 ongoing completion of preparatory activities i.e. Ordinance for the Management Team and subproject turn-over; and 
 - d) 4 under construction.
