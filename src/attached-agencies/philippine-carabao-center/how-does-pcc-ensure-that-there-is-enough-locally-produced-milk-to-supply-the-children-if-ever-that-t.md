# How does PCC ensure that there is enough locally produced milk to supply the children if ever that there will be an expansion of the number of beneficiaries and number of feeding days?


 - With the help of the Carabao-based Business Improvement Network (CBIN)/ Coconut-Carabao Development Project (CCDP) project, PCC makes sure that the future direction of the milk feeding program includes the expansion of areas in order to have more assisted cooperatives to supply milk in the program.
