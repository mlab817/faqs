# Why is the implementation of the Milk Feeding Program good for only 20-50 days instead of the 120 days provided by the law?


 - Due to limited funds allotted per School Division Office (SDO), the SDOs prioritize to feed the primary targets (kindergarten learners, Grade 1 to 6 learners who were wasted and severely wasted based on the SBFP report) and adjust the feeding days accordingly. 
 - The approved budget of DepEd for the School Based Feeding Program (SBFP) â€“ Milk Feeding component, is not enough to feed all the identified undernourished children from Kinder to Grade Six for 120 days as stipulated in the RA 11037.
