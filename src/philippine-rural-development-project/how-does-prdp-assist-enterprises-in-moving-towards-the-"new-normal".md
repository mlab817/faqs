# How does PRDP assist enterprises in moving towards the “New Normal”?


 - The Proponent Groups (PGs) were provided with training activities through virtual and blended mechanisms.
 - The PGs were assisted in tapping digital technology for market linkages and increasing sales.
 - In the North Luzon Cluster, an eMerkado Project (Tulay sa Pag-asenso, Katuwang sa Pagbabago) is being organized to connect/link PGs to potential markets through online platforms. In preparation for the launching of this e-Merkado project, the Cluster is also doing capacity building to selected PGs (such as creating online identity, packaging enhancement, logo enhancement, GCash and online payment tutorial, Shopee tutorials, etc.), preparing info materials (videos, posters, and other marketing materials) and started scouting/talking with potential buyers.
