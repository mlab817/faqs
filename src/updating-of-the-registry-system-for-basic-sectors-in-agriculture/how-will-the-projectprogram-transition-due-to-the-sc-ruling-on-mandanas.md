### Updating of the Registry System for Basic Sectors in Agriculture

## How will the project/program transition due to the SC ruling on Mandanas?


 - Once the registry system is on its final phase, i.e. the profiling of all farmers and fisherfolk has been completed and their respective geotagged farm parcel/lot linked, the updating of records will be managed by the LGUs to ensure that the registered farmer/fisher is active and thus, eligible for future interventions set by the DA.
