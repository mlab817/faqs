## Updating of the Registry System for Basic Sectors in Agriculture

# What are the program targets for FY 2022?


 - The Program aims to complete the profiling of the farmers and implement the next two (2) components (Geo-referencing of Farm Lots and the Development of the Interventions Monitoring System). Specifically, the FY 2022 will prioritize the Georeferencing component as it will ensure the integrity of the gathered data and information from the profiling component. Also, it will serve as a validation tool because it will link the collected farmer profile to the farm lot profile gathered through geo-referencing.
 - For the next two implementing years of the project (FY 2023 and FY 2024), the targets are as follows:
 - FY 2023: 1,195,600 registered farmers and 2,127,070 hectares of georeferenced farm parcels; and
 - FY 2024: 935,000 registered farmers and 2,146,955 hectares of georeferenced farm parcels.
