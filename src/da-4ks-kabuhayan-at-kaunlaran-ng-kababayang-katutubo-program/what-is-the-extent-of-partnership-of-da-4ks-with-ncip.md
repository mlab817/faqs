# What is the extent of partnership of DA-4KS with NCIP?


 - From the time a Joint Special Order No. 1 was signed by two Government Agencies between DA and NCIP spearheaded by DA 4Ks Program, the partnership of helping the Indigenous Cultural Communities/ Indigenous People (ICCs/IPs) was formalized and properly designated the functions and responsibilities of both Agencies. 
 - This is done thru the National Steering Committee, National Technical Working Group and Regional Technical Working Group in carrying out the collaborative program/project/activity pertaining to agri-fisheries and agribusiness development within the ancestral domains of a particular region.
 - At the Provincial Level, the Provincial Implementation Team (PIT) of NCIP carries out the actual collaborative implementation of the program/project/activity pertaining to agri-fisheries development, agriculture development and agribusiness undertakings within the ancestral domain of a particular province. 
 - In this regard, the DA will seek assistance from the provincial PLGUs thru the Office of the Provincial Agriculture to provide technical support in the implementation of the agricultural development projects.
