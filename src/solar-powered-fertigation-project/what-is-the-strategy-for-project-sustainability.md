### Solar-Powered Fertigation Project

## What is the strategy for project sustainability?


 - For the SPFS to be sustainable, the project beneficiaries must be knowledgeable on the operation and maintenance of the system. Capability of farmer beneficiaries will be strengthened through conduct of technical trainings as well as basic leadership trainings to further organize the farmer associations. Also, participation of the local government units must be established specially after project turn-over to the farmer associations. The LGU can provide funding for damages that may be due to force majeure or calamity.
