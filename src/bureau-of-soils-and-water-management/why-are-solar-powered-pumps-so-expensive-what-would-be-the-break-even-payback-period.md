## Why are solar powered pumps so expensive? What would be the break-even/ payback period?


 - Accounting for up to 60% of the total cost, the high cost of solar panels is the primary reason for the high price of solar-powered pumps.
 - The estimated payback period for a one (1) hp solar powered pump is three  to four years.
