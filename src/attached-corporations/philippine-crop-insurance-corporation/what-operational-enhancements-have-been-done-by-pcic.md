# What operational enhancements have been done by PCIC?


 - Innovative Insurance Product Development
 - Proposed projects for FY 2022 implementation include Comprehensive Hybrid Insurance for Rice (Indemnity and Index); and Hybrid Insurance for Rice Dry Run and Pilot (Index and Yield). 
 - On the other hand, concept notes were developed for these projects: Parametric Insurance for Landed Fish Catch/Fish Captured; and Scale-up on Satellite Imagery-Based Decision on Agricultural Insurance.
 - PCIC has recently upgraded its Quality Management System certification to ISO 9001:2015, the highest attestation in its class; 
 - Made products and services more accessible by establishing PCIC extension offices and service desks in identified areas where producers are clustered around;   
 - Addressed farmer and fisherfolk complaints about products and services in 10 days; and 
 - Released claims for indemnity in 20 days, much shorter than the 60 days provided in law.
