# Why does the Philippines import rice?


 - Small area harvested to other rice-producing countries with only around 5 million ha of rice area harvested in 2018.
 - Higher population and faster population growth rate compared with its neighboring countries.  Because of this, production could not keep up with the rising demand of the growing population.
 - Higher cost of production. For the crop year 2013-2014, Filipino farmers spent around PhP12.41 to produce a kg of palay while Thai and Vietnamese farmers spent only PhP8.85/kg and PhP6.53/kg, respectively. This makes the market price of rice higher in the country.
