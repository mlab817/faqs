# How does SRA prioritize which Infrastructure projects to implement?


 - All proposals for infrastructure projects must be duly endorsed by the Mill District Development Councils (MDDCs). 
 - In the event that the proposals exceed the budget approved in the NEP, the MDDCs will be responsible for finalizing the priority road sections for the fiscal year taking into consideration all factors in the mill district level. 
 - This is then evaluated and approved by the Infrastructure Program Committee which is composed of representatives from both the planters and millers.
 - Funding allocation for infrastructure projects is computed based on the area of sugarcane plantations per Mill District.
