##### National Convergence Initiative

## What is the NCI-SRD and how is it different from other convergence projects/programs or initiatives of government?


 - The NCI-SRD is a government strategy of the DA-DAR-DENR-DILG as the four main rural development agencies operating under its Joint Administrative Order No. 01, series of 2020.
 - Convergence Initiative is a response to the fragmented delivery of rural development services towards improved governance and optimized use of resources. It shall also strengthen the LGUs to grow sustainable economies. Interventions shall focus on smallholder farmers (both agrarian reform beneficiaries or non-ARBS), small fisherfolk, upland dwellers, and indigenous peoples (IPs) using the ridge-to-reef approach as its main tool.
