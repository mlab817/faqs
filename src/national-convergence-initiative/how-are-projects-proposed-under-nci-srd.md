### National Convergence Initiative

## How are projects proposed under NCI-SRD?


 - Projects are proposed through the Convergence Area Development Plans (CADPs) of the Local Government Units (LGUs). These are five-year development plans that outline the proposed complementation of programs/activities/projects among the DA-DAR-DENR-DILG and other partner agencies for a period of five (5) years. This interventions in the convergence areas are based on the framework of ridge-to-reef or sustainable integrated rural development (SIAD).
