##### Philippine Center for Postharvest Development and Mechanization

## How is PhilMech addressing climate change and other environmental issues?


 - The RDE programs and projects are focused on developing or improving technologies, e.g., mechanical dryers and climate-resilient storage facilities, to address erratic weather patterns and occurrences of extreme weather disturbances; developing technologies on climate-resilient crops such as corn, cassava, mungbean to ensure sustainable agriculture; designing energy-efficient/-saving technologies, e.g., technologies powered by renewable energy sources such as solar power; designing technologies to protect climate-sensitive crops such as coffee; R&D on waste and by-product utilization; and R&D on biological control of pests and diseases.
 - Accessibility of efficient and climate-resilient/-technologies for rice is made possible by the PHilMech’s role in providing rice production and post-production technologies through the RTL’s Rice Competitiveness Enhancement Program – Mechanization Component (RCEP Mechanization).
