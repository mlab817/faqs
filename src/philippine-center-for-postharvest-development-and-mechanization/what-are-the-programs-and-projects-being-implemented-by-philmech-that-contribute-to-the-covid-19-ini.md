### Philippine Center for Postharvest Development and Mechanization

## What are the programs and projects being implemented by PhilMech that contribute to the COVID-19 initiatives of the department?


 - PHilMech shall continue to conduct research, development and extension (RDE) to generate and commercialize technologies intended to reduce production cost, reduce postharvest losses, and add value to produce. These are all significant to the rebuilding efforts while the pandemic still has not yet and when it has finally seen its end. These are short-gestating projects expected to generate results that would help ease the effects of the pandemic. This includes processing to add value to commodities, increase shelf-life, and generate income.
