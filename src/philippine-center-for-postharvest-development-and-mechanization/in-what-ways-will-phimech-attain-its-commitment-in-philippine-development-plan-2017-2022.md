# In what ways will PhiMech attain its commitment in Philippine Development Plan 2017-2022?


 - During the mid-term updating of the PDP in 2019, PHilMech was tasked by the NEDA SC-AFF to add to its commitments the reduction of postharvest losses in high value crops and increase in the level of mechanization. The latter was committed in view of PHilMech’s mandate under RA 11203 or the RTL which is expected to contribute to higher mechanization level in rice. With the direct interventions deployed under RTL’s RCEF Mechanization Program it is expected that the level of mechanization has already increased to a level at par or near our Asian neighbors.
 - For these purposes, PHilMech is conducting research studies to establish the loss reduction in selected high value crops and level of mechanization on rice. PHilMech is expected to conduct the studies on a regular 6-year interval to coincide with the end of implementation of successor PDPs. These results should establish baseline data that will provide the bases for planning and policy decisions towards improving productivity, reducing losses and increasing incomes of farmers.
