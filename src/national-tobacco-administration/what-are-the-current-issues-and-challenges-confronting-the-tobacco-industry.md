# What are the current issues and challenges confronting the tobacco industry?


 - Aggressive global campaign against tobacco and smoking and implementing tobacco control measures as the countryâ€™s commitment to WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC);
 - The aggressive government campaign and strong lobby from the health sector against smoking;
 - Increasing import liberalization and global competition;
 - Continuing increase on domestic taxation of cigarettes pursuant to Sin Tax Reform Law (RA 10351) resulted in the decreased demand of tobacco products as well as volume of cigarette production, number of farmers, decline in area and leaf production, among others.  With the enactment of  Tobacco Tax Law (RA 11346) in July 2019, the same downtrend is expected; and
 - Aging tobacco farmers and scarcity of labor in tobacco production.
