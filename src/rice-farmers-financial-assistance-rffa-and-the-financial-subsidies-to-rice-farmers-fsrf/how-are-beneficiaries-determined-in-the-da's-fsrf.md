## Rice Farmers Financial Assistance (RFFA) and the Financial Subsidies to Rice Farmers (FSRF)

# How are beneficiaries determined in the DA’s FSRF?


 - Qualifications for beneficiaries under FSRF Program include: a) must be registered in the Registry System for Basic Sectors in Agriculture (RSBSA) as per approved registration and updating protocol; and b) must be tilling rice areas of 0.5-2.0 hectares.
 - The FSRF caters to smallholder rice farmers whose farm size ranges one (1) hectare and below. Implementation of FSRF prioritizes RCEF provinces not covered under RFFA and provinces affected by decline in palay farmgate prices (Mar-Dec 2019).
