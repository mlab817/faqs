### Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority

## How does the FPA address the high cost of fertilizer?


 - Since the FPA does not regulate prices of fertilizers and pesticides pursuant to massive trade liberalization efforts of the government way back in 1986 which led the agency to discontinue import permit issuance and price-setting, it merely encourages fair market competition. 
 - The FPA ensures that the registration of fertilizer and pesticide products complies with timelines set forth in the Citizenâ€™s Charter so that more brands/products become available in the market as soon as possible. 
 - The agency monitors the prices of fertilizers and pesticides across different locations nationwide and submit weekly monitoring reports to the DA.
