##### Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority

## How does FPA address the proliferation of illegitimate online sellers and distribution of illegal fertilizer and pesticide products?


 - The FPA is currently coordinating with the Department of Trade and Industry and other regulatory agencies to come up with a joint order to regulate the online selling of such agricultural inputs in different online platforms. Likewise, the Agency has already coordinated with these online selling platforms and educated them on the need for products and handlers (sellers) to undergo registration and accreditation prior to engaging in such activity.
 - The public are also continuously advised to avoid and report unscrupulous sellers of such unregistered products.
