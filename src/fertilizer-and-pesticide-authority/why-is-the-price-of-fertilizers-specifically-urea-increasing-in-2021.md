# Why is the price of fertilizers, specifically urea, increasing in 2021?


 - The global prices of urea started to increase in April 2021, primarily due to its global supply movement as there is a strong demand and higher input costs. Since most of our supply of urea are sourced abroad, then consequently, local prices will correspondingly increase.
 - Other phosphate raw materials such as sulfur and ammonia have also increased sharply due to limited supplies caused by COVID-19 restrictions.
