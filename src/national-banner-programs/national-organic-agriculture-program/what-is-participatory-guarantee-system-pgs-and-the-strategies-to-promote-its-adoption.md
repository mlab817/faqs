# What is Participatory Guarantee System (PGS) and the strategies to promote its adoption?


 - PGS is a locally-focused quality assurance system that is developed and practiced by people engaged in organic agriculture. PGS is built on a foundation of trust, social networks, and knowledge exchange that should be used to certify producers and farmers as actual and active practitioners of the industry. 
 - With the provision of incentives and institutionalization of the reward system, may it be either institutional,  technical, or financial resources, the organic agriculture farmers and fisherfolks will be attracted in engaging into the second party certification, or specifically the PGS.
