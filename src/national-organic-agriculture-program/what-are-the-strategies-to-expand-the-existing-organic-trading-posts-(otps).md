## What are the strategies to expand the existing Organic Trading Posts (OTPs)?


 - With the establishment of an organic agriculture hub or "Organik Konek",  all stages in the value-chain,  from the Farm  Inputs  (land preparation)  to the  Marketing will be addressed. The OTPs, which are known to be a market area for all organic produce, will be considered as the marketing component of the organic agriculture hub. These will pave the way for having one-stop-shop organic inputs and products. Existing OTPâ€™s may still continue to operate as it is but the NOAP highly suggests applying as an Organic Hub to enhance their current status.
