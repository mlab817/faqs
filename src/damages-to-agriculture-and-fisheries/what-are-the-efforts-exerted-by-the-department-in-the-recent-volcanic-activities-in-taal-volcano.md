# What are the efforts exerted by the Department in the recent volcanic activities in Taal Volcano?


 - Collection, updating and dissemination of information - The DA-RFO CALABARZON activated its Emergency Operations Center to monitor the activities of the volcano, coordinating with PHIVOLCS and the surrounding LGUs. Available buffer stocks, resources and animal evacuation centers were also being updated. Animal inventory and standing crops on vulnerable areas were also checked. With this, information were disseminated to farmers and fisherfolk. 
 - Provision of alternative source of income to fish cage operators - The BFAR-CALABARZON maintained close coordination with LGUs surrounding the Taal Volcano island. To assist fish cage operators in the area, the said office facilitated the transport of 6.8 MT marketable size tilapia in July 2021. 
 - Consultation on the needs for animal rescue and relief - The BAI had a consultation meeting with Batangas Provincial Veterinary Office (PVO) on their needs related to animal rescue and relief. An ocular inspection was also conducted on the five identified high risk barangays (for livestock) in Laurel and Agoncillo.
