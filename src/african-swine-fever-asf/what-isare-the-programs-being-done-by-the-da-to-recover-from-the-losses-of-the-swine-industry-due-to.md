# What is/are the program/s being done by the DA to recover from the losses of the swine industry due to the ASF?


 - The Department of Agriculture through the National Livestock Program and the Bureau of Animal Industry launched the twin program: 
 - BABay ASF Program - a community- based approach to prevent, control, and manage ASF applying sound epidemiologic principles and available technology such as the use of ASF rapid test kits, through the cooperation of Local Government Units (LGU) and swine raisers; and
 - INSPIRE Program - focuses on increasing the swine inventory and breeder base as well as clustering and consolidation strategies specifically of small hold raisers to facilitate technical support services and other interventions along the value chain.
