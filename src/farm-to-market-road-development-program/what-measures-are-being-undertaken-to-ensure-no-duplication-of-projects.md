##### Farm-to-Market Road Development Program

## What measures are being undertaken to ensure no duplication of projects?


 - For all projects, a process of validation was undertaken by the DA-Regional Field Offices. 
 - During validation, the proposed projects were geotagged to get the exact location and avoid overlapping. 
 - Moreover, projects were cross-checked with other concerned agencies/programs (like DOT, DTI, DAR, SRA, DSWD, PCA, PRDP, DPWH (LIP/Regular fund) and DILG).
