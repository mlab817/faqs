# What is the status of the Rice Roadmap?


 - The crafting of the rice roadmap is currently commissioned by the Asian Development Bank. As of August 2021, ADB has engaged the services of Pacific Rim Innovation and Management Exponents (PRIMEX) Inc. for this activity. The inception report has been prepared which was presented last August 18 to the DA review team for comments. Expected finish of this roadmapping activity is on January 2022.
