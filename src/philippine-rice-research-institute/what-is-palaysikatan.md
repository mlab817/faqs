# What is PalaySikatan?


 - PalaySikatan is a technology demonstration strategy used by the RCEF Seed Program to showcase among diverse groups of farmers and other rice stakeholders the benefits of using inbred certified seeds and mechanized farming system.  Each techno demo site features the three national and two regional recommended varieties promoted under RCEF.  In addition, one to two newly released varieties are introduced.  These will eventually be offered to farmers as an option to further increase their productivity.
 - DA-PhilRice, in coordination with DA-RFOs and LGUs (Provincial/Municipal/City), prioritizes the establishment of techno-demo sites in provinces with low to medium yields, and low farmersâ€™ adoption of certified seeds.  
 - DA-PhilRice provides a counterpart financial support to farmer-partners to cover the cost of material inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, plant protection, and rental of machinery for land preparation and crop establishment. In turn, the farmer-partners provide counterpart funding for other material inputs, crop care and maintenance, and harvesting and threshing. 
 - The number of PalaySikatan technology demonstration sites has consistently increased from 35 in 2020 Dry Season (DS), 99 in 2020 Wet Season (WS), to 121 in 2021 DS. Based on the data collected from farmer-partners participating in the technology demonstration, the yield attained across locations in 2020 DS averaged 4.32 MT/ha with a cash cost of PhP 12.01/kg.
 - In 2020 WS, the average yield further improved to 5.0 MT/ha and the cash cost was reduced to PhP 9.28/kg, which exhibits that the proper use of technology can enhance productivity and competitiveness of rice farmers.
