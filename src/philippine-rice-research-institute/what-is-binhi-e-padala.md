# What is Binhi e-Padala?


 - Binhi e-Padala is a digital technology-aided Rice Competitiveness Enhancement Fund (RCEF) Seed distribution scheme. Registry System for Basic Sectors in Agriculture (RSBSA)-registered farmers with validated mobile phone numbers receive a claim code/voucher through SMS (text message) from DA-PhilRice.  They use it in claiming RCEF seeds from designated pick-up locations of participating seed grower cooperatives/associations.
 - In this system, partner-seed grower cooperatives/associations manage the distribution of seeds.  They use the mobile application to read codes and process the claim of farmer-beneficiaries.  This method is more convenient for farmers who have access to mobile phones since they are informed earlier of the exact date and location of RCEF seed distribution.
 - RCEF Binhi e-Padala beneficiaries shall present their claim code sent through SMS, RSBSA stub, and valid ID at the designated pick-up location.
