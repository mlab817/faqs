## How does the Participatory Guarantee System (PGS) work?


 - PGS, in reference to RA 11511, refers to a locally-focused quality assurance system which is developed and practiced by people actually engaged in organic agriculture.  It is built on a foundation of trust, social network, and knowledge exchange. PGS is used to certify producers and farmers as actual and active organic agriculture practitioners and serve as an alternative to third-party certification.
 - Once a farmer member gets certification following the participatory certification process of the accredited PGS group, he/she can now label and sell the produce and products as guaranteed organic. He/she can also use the Philippine PGS Guaranteed Organic mark.
 - By bringing more farmers into a system of committed organic production, and linking that to direct and local sales, PGS offers much wider access to organic produce and products to consumers.
