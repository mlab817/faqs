## How can PGS help small farmers and fisherfolk?


 - PGS primarily helps small farmers and fisherfolk by getting organically certified at a low cost.  
 - PGS also empowers groups of small farmers and fisherfolk by allowing them to operate as a certification body, ensuring that they maintain the quality of certification services, and the integrity of products being certified as organic. A group of farmers may formally establish a group as PGS supported by concerned members of the community such as the consumers, suppliers and other stakeholders.
