## High Value Crops Development Program

# What are the actions being done by the program to protect the market share of our export crops?


 - Technological and institutional innovations were introduced to Adaptation and Mitigation Initiative in Agriculture (AMIA) Villages like soilless agriculture (e.g. Hydroponics, Aeroponics & Vertical Farming) so that they can produce off-season vegetables/crops, and livestock production to increase their income during wet and dry season;
 - DA-RFOs disseminate early warnings or advisories on weather forecast in coordination with PAGASA. Through the early advisories, the farmers can decide if they want to harvest early to save more produce;    
 - HVCDP invested in more climate-proof structures such as monolothic dome, cold storages, and hangers to protect food from flood;
 - HVCDP practices buffer stocking, promotion of resilient crops such as root crops and cropping systems; and
 - HVCDP provides Solar Powered Irrigation System (SPIS) to promote more efficient and clean energy in irrigating farm lands.
 - Coordination with IAD and PRS with regard to tariff trade negotiations and market access negotiation;
 - Collaboration with BPI and BAFS for the compliance of exporters/ producers  with SPS and MRL standards (BPI,BAFS);
 - Provides quality agricultural inputs to ensure high-quality and disease-free harvests that are certain to pass the requirements of the export markets. Area expansion, and quality planting materials and related inputs have been instrumental in scaling production according to external demands; and 
 - Processing, storage, and similar facilities, including innovative technologies, are also constantly added, maintained and upgraded as part of the value chain for priority high value export crops.
