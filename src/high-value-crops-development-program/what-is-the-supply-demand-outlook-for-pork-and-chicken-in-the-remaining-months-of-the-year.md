# What is the supply-demand outlook for pork and chicken in the remaining months of the year?


 - There is a projected production deficit in pork for the year with the 4th quarter having the highest deficit at 199,344 metric tons equivalent to 45 days, but this will be addressed through the end of the year as the holidays come, since more imports will be utilized by this time.
 - For chicken, there is a projected surplus in chicken meat throughout the year. The highest projected surplus is in the 3rd and 4th quarter at 42,949 and 41,928 metric tons.
