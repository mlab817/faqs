# How does NDA help address the inadequate number of dairy stocks?


 - Herd Build Up Program:
 - Intensified Breeding and Artificial Insemination (AI) Programs in cooperation with LGUs, Unified National Artificial Insemination Program (UNAIP) and other dairy partners;
 - Adoption of latest dairy technology for genetic improvement, e.g., artificial insemination using sexed semen with slick genes (for heat tolerance);
 - Production of semen straws from locally-produced genetically superior dairy breed;
 - Establishing local sources of dairy animals. Adoption of a clustered-base dairy farming system is promoted and these farms will serve as dairy production areas and multiplier farms that will serve as local suppliers of dairy animals;
 - Preservation of Local Dairy Stocks thru the Buy-back Program.
 - Strict implementation of the dairy herd health and nutrition program to prevent and treat diseases and improve dairy animal performance in terms of reproduction and milk production; and
 - Importation of genetic materials like dairy animals and semen.
 - Buyback Program. An effective strategy to keep dairy animals for dairy purposes - for milk production and for dairy animal reproduction, was developed through the Buyback Program. With the program, the NDA procures local-born dairy animals from qualified dairy farmers who opt to sell them, and these animals are distributed to interested new and/or existing dairy farmers. The program is continuously being implemented in all dairy areas. Some 4,680 heads were purchased by the program from 2012-2020.
 - NDAâ€™s jurisdiction includes milk production and postharvest handling.
 - The NDA shall enforce the Dairy Safety Regulation Standards and ensure compliance by the dairy farmers and all stakeholders involved in milk production and post-harvest activities. The NDA shall conduct dairy farm and plant registration and dairy farm audit to ensure the adoption of quality standard protocols.
