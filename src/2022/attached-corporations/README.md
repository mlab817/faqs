It aims to address undernutrition in the country while providing market and income opportunities for local dairy farmers and cooperatives.\nWith the passage of RA 11037 or the Masustansiyang Pagkain Para sa Batang Pilipino Act, the milk feeding program was institutionalized to daycare schools (supervised by the DSWD) and elementary public schools (handled by the DepEd). Despite the pandemic, the program is ongoing, with local dairy farmers, cooperatives and producers providing the milk supply.\nNDA has tapped 62 dairy cooperatives, private farms, SUCs and LGUs as local dairy suppliers and a total of 9,926,952.6 liters of milk were supplied in the Milk Feeding Program, where 972,696 liters of milk were supplied to DSWD and 8,954,256.6 liters of milk were supplied to DepEd.\nFor DSWD, their 10th cycle of the supplemental feeding program (SFP) was  concluded in June 2021, serving a total of 40,529 beneficiaries.\nFor DepEd, the 2020 school-based feeding program (SBFP) implementation is currently ongoing with a total of 1,466,872 beneficiaries.","page":"","slug":"what-is-the-status-of-ndas-milk-feeding-program"},{"id":120,"category":"Attached Corporations","topic":"National Dairy Authority","question":"What are the challenges encountered in implementation?","response":"Challenges include restrictions brought about by the pandemic and difficulties in procurement, especially the use of public bidding to procure from local dairy farmers and cooperatives.

An effective strategy to keep dairy animals for dairy purposes - for milk production and for dairy animal reproduction, was developed through the Buyback Program. With the program, the NDA procures local-born dairy animals from qualified dairy farmers who opt to sell them, and these animals are distributed to interested new and/or existing dairy farmers. The program is continuously being implemented in all dairy areas. Some 4,680 heads were purchased by the program from 2012-2020.\nNDA’s jurisdiction includes milk production and postharvest handling.\nThe NDA shall enforce the Dairy Safety Regulation Standards and ensure compliance by the dairy farmers and all stakeholders involved in milk production and post-harvest activities.
