 - Canine Rabies: The goal for rabies- free Philippines by 2030 and no human rabies case by 2027 is being done through close collaboration with DOH, DILG, LGUs and private sector. Continuous implementation of mass dog/cat vaccination to reduce rabies incidence is being done. Also, there is a progressive local declaration of rabies- free areas being conducted.
 - Classical Swine Fever (Hog Cholera): Mindanao Island is being targeted as a locally declared CSF-free zone with vaccination. This will be subjected to  compliance with requirements in the OIE Terrestrial Code Guidelines for CSF-free status declaration through zonal approach. This will be followed by the islands of Visayas and Northern Luzon where filed cases are seldom reported.
