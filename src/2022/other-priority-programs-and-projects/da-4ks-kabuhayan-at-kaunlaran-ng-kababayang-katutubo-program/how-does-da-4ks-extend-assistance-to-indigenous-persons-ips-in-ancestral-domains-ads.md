# How does DA-4KS extend assistance to Indigenous Persons (IPs) in Ancestral Domains (ADs)?


 - To strengthen the assistance to ICCs/IPs, the DA 4Ks coordinates with DA-RFOs, DA-Banner Programs, DA-NCIP RTWG and PLGU to conduct culture-based, culture-sensitive dite actual social preparation activities of the PAPs on the ground to ensure its success and empowerment, and build the capacity of Indigenous Cultural Communities/Indigenous Peoples (ICCs/IPs) to ensure their active participation in the implementation. 
 - Assistance is also done thru institutionalizing the development of Indigenous Peoples Organizations (IPO), Indigenous Peoples Associations (IPA) and other organizations within the ICCs/IPs.
