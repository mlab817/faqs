# Why did the project chose three (3) river basins only? How about the others? How were the project areas selected?


 Project sites were identified based on the following set of criteria: 
 1. Target sites are rainfed and upland areas not covered by the National Irrigation Administration and without an existing or functioning irrigation system.
 1. Presence of built-up areas as well as agricultural or fishery activities in the area. 
 1. If former criteria are not applicable, target areas are considered as expansion for agricultural development based on Network of Protected Areas for Agricultural and Agro-Industrial Development (NPAAAD) and Strategic Agriculture and Fisheries Development Zone (SAFDZ). 
 1. Suitable sites for small scale irrigation systems based on BSWM master plan.
 1. Willingness of LGUs, farmers and residents to provide counterpart or share in the construction of RWCS. 
 1. Occurrence of destructive flooding downstream of the macro watersheds.
