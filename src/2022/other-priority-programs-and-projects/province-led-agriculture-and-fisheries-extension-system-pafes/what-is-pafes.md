# What is PAFES?


 - The Province-led Agriculture and Fisheries Extension System (PAFES) is an integrative and convergence strategy of DA to pursue a systematic and strategic approach and strong and sustained partnerships with LGU, private sectors, farmers’ and fishers’ groups, and other national government agencies.
 - DA-RFOs are to pilot at least one (1) province in 2021 and shall eventually cover all provinces within the region.
