 | Profiling 		| Target 	|  Accomplished					 |
 | :--------------- | :-------: | :----------------------------: |
 | Forms submitted	| 3,033,473	| 3,129,033 (as of 30 June 2021) |
 | Forms encoded	| 3,033,473 | 2,390,444 (as of 30 June 2021) |

 - The backlog in encoding was due to forms that consist of errors or incomplete data that were returned (or subject to be returned) to the respective MAO to revalidate the farmer's information.
