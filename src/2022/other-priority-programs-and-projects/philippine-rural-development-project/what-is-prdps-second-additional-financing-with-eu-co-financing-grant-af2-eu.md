# What is PRDP’s second additional financing with E.U. Co-Financing Grant (AF2-EU)?


 - On June 17, 2021, the Board of Executive Directors of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) of the World Bank approved the $280 million Second Additional Financing with EUR18.3 million E.U. Co-financing grant.
 - The AF2 is the second tranche of the $450 million AF from the World Bank. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the AF2 was retrofitted to complement the DA’s initiatives towards food security and resiliency.
 - It is expected that the AF2-EU will be benefitted by more than 300,000 farmer and fisherfolk households, as well as more than 70,000 additional jobs created from rural infrastructure subprojects and enterprise activities.
 - The signing of the Loan Agreement and related documents for the DA-PRDP AF2 is anticipated to happen on or before July 15, 2021 and the implementation is expected to start in the last quarter of 2021.
