# How does the DA provide early warning to farming and fishing communities to mitigate losses from incoming extreme events?


 - The issuance of Memorandum Circular no. 04, s.2020 mandates every DA-RFOs to provide Farming-Fishing Advisories based on weather and climate outlook as a basic service. We have built the capacity of our RFOs in providing farm-fishing advisories by using the methodology developed by our experts from the DA RFO V.
 - Today, our RFOs are capable of providing Regional and Provincial Seasonal Climate Outlook Advisories and 10-day and Special Farm Weather Outlook and Advisory by translating the weather forecasts of PAGASA. Through this, our farmersâ€“fisherfolk become aware of the steps they can take given a specific weather condition as they maintain efficient farm activities and crop status. By providing this service of early warning, input losses and production damage are minimized.
