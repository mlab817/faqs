# What is the status of the implementation of the trading centers?


 - As of June 2021, there are 26 APTCs nationwide at various stages of implementation: 
   - 12 operational APTCs; 
   - 6 not operational (due to the covid-19 pandemic, lack of trading capital, among others); 
   - 4 ongoing completion of preparatory activities i.e. Ordinance for the Management Team and subproject turn-over; and 
   - 4 under construction.
