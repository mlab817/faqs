# How will the program be rolled out?


 - Phase 1: Awareness raising and team-building. This includes the setting-up of the Technology Business Incubator (TBI) project team, crafting of a workplan and awareness-raising of the TBI project. 
 - Phase 2: Preparation of a Feasibility Study (FS). This is to determine the technical feasibility and financial viability of the project, starting with the services that it aims to offer, in this case, targeting a particular industry or sector to establish if there is sufficient demand from prospective entrepreneurs, the kind of infrastructures and support services that a TBI provides, and how will its target customers pay for such services. 
 - Phase 3: The Business Plan. This includes a concrete TBI model elaborated in financial figures, the kind of support that can be provided by the TBI to meet the needs of its customers; how the TBI will be organized and operated; and how all of this can be financed.
 - Phase 4: Implementation. This includes the selection of qualified incubator staff, conduct of a set of special training to handle TBI operations, selection criteria for incubatees and tools to effectively support its clients.
