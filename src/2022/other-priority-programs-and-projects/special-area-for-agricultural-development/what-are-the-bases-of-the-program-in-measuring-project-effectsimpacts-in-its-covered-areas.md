# What are the bases of the program in measuring project effects/impacts in its covered areas?


 - Database of Beneficiaries and Geotagging activities – Socio-economic and agri-related data are gathered during the identification of SAAD beneficiaries. These data will serve as the baseline of the program in assessing the effects of its interventions in the succeeding years.
 - Program Management Support Offices (PPMSO) monitoring – SAAD has created PPMSO that are stationed in the covered provinces/ municipalities. It is mostly comprised of COS personnel that function as Provincial and Area Coordinators. They are the actual personnel that monitor the implementation of the program and are the report generators of the program.
 - M&E Reporting – In FY 2020, due to COVID pandemic, the program devised a reporting form covering the status of the farmers implementing the projects from distribution, planting, harvesting and marketing activities.
 - Others:
 - Compilation of SAAD Success Stories – since the program is in its 4th year, there are already projects that are evidently successful. These success stories are documented and promoted during report submissions, presentations, and activities of the program;
 - SAAD Saga – the latest initiative of the program is SAAD Saga. This is an activity that showcases livelihood projects or enterprises which are performing well. The beneficiaries are able to share their project experiences and also promote their produce or products; and
 - Other Agency Official Reports (NEDA, DBM, PSA, SUCs, etc) – the program also considers official reports/ publications of other agencies in the effects brought about by the implementation of the SAAD program in the decrease of poverty incidence in its covered provinces. It will also conduct a Midterm Assessment to be conducted by DMMMSU in FY 2020 – 2021 to identify the immediate effects of the program.
