# What will happen to the remaining ACEF Fund after 2022 when the collection of duties from the Minimum Access Volume (MAV) mechanism and the setting aside of the amount collected for the purpose shall terminate?


 - Any remaining balance after 2022 shall not revert to the General Fund but shall continue to be used for the purpose for which it was collected and set aside.
