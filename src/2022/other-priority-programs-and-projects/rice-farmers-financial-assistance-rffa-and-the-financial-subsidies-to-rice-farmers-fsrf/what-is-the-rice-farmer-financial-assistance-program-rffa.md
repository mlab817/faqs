# What is the Rice Farmer Financial Assistance Program (RFFA)?


 - Presidential Directive Item No. 2 issued on November 21, 2019, called for an urgent need to set up the Rice Farmer Financial Assistance (RFFA) this year to cater most affected smallholder rice farmers whose farm sizes range from 0.5 to 2 hectares, and to compensate for their income loss due to the decline in palay prices.
 - The requested initial PhP 3 billion RFFA fund was not under RCEF but sourced from the excess revenue of the National Government.
 - This shall be distributed to rice farmers with land holdings from 0.5 to 2.0 ha in most affected provinces, catering 33 provinces with a target of 597,404 rice farmer beneficiaries.
 - Affected rice farmers shall receive cash assistance amounting to Five Thousand Pesos (PhP 5,000.00) through the Land Bank of the Philippines and Development Bank of the Philippines. Distribution and payment modes are done through LBP Cash Cards and DBP Accredited Payout Outlets.
