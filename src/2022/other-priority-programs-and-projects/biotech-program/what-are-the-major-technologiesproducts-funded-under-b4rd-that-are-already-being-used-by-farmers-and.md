# What are the major technologies/products funded under B4RD that are already being used by farmers and for validation or upscaling?


 - Technologies generated used by farmers and other end-users:
 - Orgullo Tall Synthetic Coconut Variety- a total of 1.1M planting materials were distributed to 14 regions.  
 - Biocontrol agents against Coconut Leaf Beetle- Mass Rearing Facilities are being implemented by PCA regional offices.
 - Lamp-based protocol for detection of Rice Tungro Bacilliform Virus (RTBV) in plants- used by PhilRice in their research stations.
 - Database for Regulated Aquatic Species in the Philippines named NFRDI-GFL database- the database is fully functional and stored 607 specimens with trace files. 
 - 
 - Other technologies/products generated that are for validation/upscaling:
 - Guava-based probiotic drink- currently on patent application.
 - Protocol of hydrolysis for yellowfin tuna- Technology was endorsed to Santech Feeds Corporation in 2020; Produces high protein, low-salt fish protein hydrolysate.
 - Protocol for mass propagation of makapuno- currently on patent application.
 - Protocol for extracting fucoidan from seaweeds- The Technology Transfer Unit of UP Diliman is planning to review the project for possible patents.
 - 
 - Other technologies/products generated that are for validation/upscaling:
 - Molecular Marker Diagnostic Kit for Durian- Currently under pilot testing
 - Bio-Nol for ethanol production- already applied for a trademark on the label of BIONOL
 - Caprine Arthritis Encephalitis Virus (CAEV) test kit- a patent application was submitted on April 20, 2019; Used on-site to detect CAEV on goats.
 - Biofertilizers- Phospholink is already licensed under FPA; Nitrolink and Mycolink are used in some plantation crops. 
 - Detection protocol of PLCzeta protein in buffalo semen- Working with PCC on the uptake of these molecular technologies.
 - 
 - Technologies for technology transfer
 - Papaya varieties with tolerance to Papaya Ring-Spot Virus (PRSV)- the licensing of the varieties is underway; DA RFOs are being trained in the mass propagation of these varieties.
 - Optimized processing technology for Red Mold Rice- looking for potential takers of the technology.
