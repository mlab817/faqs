# What is the challenge in devolution of agri-fishery functions and recommendations to address this?


 - Devolution of 5th and 6th Class municipalities will take place in CY 2024.
 - There is no assurance of funding allocation for agri-fishery functions/ PAPs with the LGUs fiscal autonomy. 
 - There is a need to assess of the readiness of the LGUs to assume the devolved functions.
