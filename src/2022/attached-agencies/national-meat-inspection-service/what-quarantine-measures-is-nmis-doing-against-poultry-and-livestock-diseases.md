# What quarantine measures is NMIS doing against poultry and livestock diseases?


 - NMIS Central Office and Regional Offices, in collaboration with LGUs, conduct continuous extensive monitoring of markets and other distribution channels to ensure that no meat coming from banned countries may be sold.
 - Expert and Prompt Response using Event-based Surveillance (ExPRESS) is a surveillance system patterned after the Event-based Surveillance to provide early detection and timely response to threats in animal health, public health, and food safety. It also provides for a better coordination and communication between human and animal health agencies in addressing threats and challenges brought about by diseases that may be emerging (unknown) or re-emerging.
