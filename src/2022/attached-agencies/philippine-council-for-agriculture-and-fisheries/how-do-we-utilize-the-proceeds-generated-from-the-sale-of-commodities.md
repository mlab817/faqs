# How do we utilize the proceeds generated from the sale of commodities?


 - Proceeds generated are utilized to fund projects such as:
 - Support for market development projects;
 - Support of research programs, projects, activities, equipment and supplies at the Department of Agriculture (DA) supported research stations and institutes and/or Philippine colleges and universities; and
 - Support for programs to strengthen the ties between the DA and Philippine agricultural colleges and universities.
 - Out of the total amount generated from the peso proceeds, the NAFC, now PCAF, has utilized and allocated PhP 11.52 B for agriculture development projects in support of the AFMA.
