# What were the actions undertaken to ban hazardous pesticides?


 - The FPA restricts and bans pesticides that exceeds the Maximum Residue Limit (MRL) or the maximum concentration of a pesticide residue permitted in or on agricultural commodity, or animal feed, through issuance of FPA Board Resolutions and FPA Circulars after consultation with various industry stakeholders and other government agencies.
 - Certain pesticides to be registered by FPA should be within standard toxicity levels to protect the environment and public health. The FPA has the obligation to regularly monitor and enforce confiscation.
 - The FPA conducts information and education campaign to enjoin the public to avoid/discontinue the use of these inputs and to report incidences of their continued use and distribution to FPA.
