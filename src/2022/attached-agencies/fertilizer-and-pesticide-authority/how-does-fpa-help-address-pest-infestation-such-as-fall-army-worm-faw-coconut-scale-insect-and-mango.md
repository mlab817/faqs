# How does FPA help address pest infestation such as Fall Army Worm (FAW), Coconut Scale insect and Mango Weevil?


 - The FPA is mandated to assure the public of safe and adequate supply of fertilizers, pesticides and other agricultural chemicals through the issuance of licenses, registrations and permits. Applications for pesticide registrations to combat the infestations have been prioritized as the situation requires. 
 - The FPA regularly issues the list of its registered fertilizer and pesticides categorized according to their appropriate application for specific pest, plant disease and crops. Likewise, the agency coordinates with relevant industry stakeholders and government agencies like the DA Pest Surveillance Unit and the Bureau of Plant Industry (BPI) for the monitoring and control of such incidents.
 - Information regarding FPA’s list of registered inputs for the control of pest infestations such as fall army worm (FAW) and coconut weevil are published in the FPA’s website (http://fpa.da.gov.ph).
