# What is the status of RCEF program implementation?


 - As of May 2021, of the PhP 30 billion appropriation for the program from 2019 to 2021, PhP 14.5 billion was obligated and PhP 8.2 billion was disbursed.
 - Challenges encountered:
 - Mechanization: There is delay in the disbursement of fund since PHilMech cannot pay the supplier unless the machine was delivered. On top of this, municipal lockdowns brought by the pandemic prohibit the delivery of machinery which result to delays in delivery schedule;
 - Extension: Shift to blended learning scheme caused a delay in disbursement of funds, particularly the budget for trainings, and Knowledge Sharing and Learning (KSL) activities such as webinars, e-talakayan, and SOA, among others;
 - Delayed release of Notice of Cash Allocation (NCA) to implementing agencies (end of first quarter); and
 - Travel restrictions and quarantine protocols.
 - To address these challenges: 
 - For the mechanization component, the bidding process was conducted in April 2021 and is projected to obligate its remaining funds by December 2021; and
 - The Extension Component adjusted its fund allocation to adapt to the new normal to speed up disbursement.
