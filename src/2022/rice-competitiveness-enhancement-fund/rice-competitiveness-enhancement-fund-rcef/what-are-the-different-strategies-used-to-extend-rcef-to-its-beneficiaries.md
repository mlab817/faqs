# What are the different strategies used to extend RCEF to its beneficiaries?


 - IAs like ATI developed a text message blast to inform the beneficiaries for promotion and information purposes;
 - Technical Briefings, online training activities, and distribution of IEC materials were conducted to foster information awareness and dissemination. Facebook and other social media sites were used to announce activity schedules;
 - Close coordination with partner P/C/MLGUs were practiced to reach out to program beneficiaries;
 - For Seed Program, a smartphone based-system was developed and deployed for use by partner LGUs to facilitate the distribution of seeds to farmers; and
 - Partner LGUs were also provided with IEC materials (e.g. videos, calendars, etc.) that were shown/given to farmer-beneficiaries as they received the seeds.
