On top of this, municipal lockdowns brought by the pandemic prohibit the delivery of machinery which result to delays in delivery schedule;\nExtension: Shift to blended learning scheme caused a delay in disbursement of funds, particularly the budget for trainings, and Knowledge Sharing and Learning (KSL) activities such as webinars, e-talakayan, and SOA, among others;\nDelayed release of Notice of Cash Allocation (NCA) to implementing agencies (end of first quarter); and\nTravel restrictions and quarantine protocols.\nTo address these challenges: \nFor the mechanization component, the bidding process was conducted in April 2021 and is projected to obligate its remaining funds by December 2021; and\nThe Extension Component adjusted its fund allocation to adapt to the new normal to speed up disbursement.","page":"","slug":"what-is-the-status-of-rcef-program-implementation"},{"id":21,"category":"Rice Competitiveness Enhancement Fund","topic":"Rice Competitiveness Enhancement Fund (RCEF)","question":"What are the different strategies used to extend RCEF to its beneficiaries?","response":"IAs like ATI developed a text message blast to inform the beneficiaries for promotion and information purposes;\nTechnical Briefings, online training activities, and distribution of IEC materials were conducted to foster information awareness and dissemination. Facebook and other social media sites were used to announce activity schedules;\nClose coordination with partner P/C/MLGUs were practiced to reach out to program beneficiaries;\nFor Seed Program, a smartphone based-system was developed and deployed for use by partner LGUs to facilitate the distribution of seeds to farmers; and\nPartner LGUs were also provided with IEC materials (e.g. videos, calendars, etc.) that were shown/given to farmer-beneficiaries as they received the seeds.","page":"","slug":"what-are-the-different-strategies-used-to-extend-rcef-to-its-beneficiaries"},{"id":22,"category":"Rice Competitiveness Enhancement Fund","topic":"Rice Competitiveness Enhancement Fund (RCEF)","question":"What are the key findings from the rapid assessment made on RCEF?","response":"The key findings are as follows: \nFragmentation of RCEF Program M&E system reflects lack of integration and synergy among the four (4) program components;\nGood M&E practices, underpinned by strong research orientation, are present as exhibited by PhilRice; and\nRice farmers and their FCAs can be more than just passive recipients of program interventions, rather they can participate more actively in the conduct of M&E activities.\nThese key findings are being addressed by the RCEF program through the following solutions: (1) the RCEF will devise a unified data capture form for monitoring and evaluation; (2) PhilRice will share its M&E practices and support the other IAs in developing its own M&E system; and (3) beneficiaries will be more involved in data gathering for M&E.\nRCEF is being assisted by FAO for the establishment of the RCEF-Impact Monitoring System that will be used as an M&E tool on the upcoming 3rd year program evaluation.","page":"","slug":"what-are-the-key-findings-from-the-rapid-assessment-made-on-rcef"},{"id":23,"category":"Rice Competitiveness Enhancement Fund","topic":"Rice Competitiveness Enhancement Fund (RCEF)","question":"What are the strategies to ensure there is no duplication of beneficiaries of the RCEF Seed Program getting the same interventions from the National Rice Program (NRP)?","response":"The duplication of beneficiaries for RCEF and NRP was prevented through the delineation of provinces. Starting 2021 Wet Season (WS), the RCEF Seed Program focused on 42 of the 57 provinces which have relatively low yield and have low adoption of certified seeds. \nMeanwhile, the remaining 15 provinces which were selected based on largest area planted to hybrid were covered by the National Rice Program/Rice Resiliency Program.\nFurther, close coordination with LGUs and RFOs is being practiced and observed.","page":"","slug":"what-are-the-strategies-to-ensure-there-is-no-duplication-of-beneficiaries-of-the-rcef-seed-program-"}],"rice-competitiveness-enhancement-fund-rice-extension-services-program":[{"id":24,"category":"Rice Competitiveness Enhancement Fund","topic":"Rice Competitiveness Enhancement Fund- Rice Extension Services Program","question":"What are \"farm schools\" tasked with implementing the Farmers Field School (FFS)?","response":"Farm Schools are sites where the FFS and other relevant training programs for farmers are conducted.
